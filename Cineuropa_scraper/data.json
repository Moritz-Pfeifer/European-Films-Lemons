Playing Mitchell more as young turk than macho stud, Allen brings a boyish vulnerability, ego and panic to the part, rooting the role someplace real. Mitchell is practically atremble at the prospect of allowing this possibility of personal fulfillment to enter his life, and he's terrified of the consequences of his tentative actions.\rThough the hyper-rhythms of Julie White (who won a Tony as barracuda talent agent Diane) are instilled in the character, the role is still ripe for the fearless.\rCandy Buckley seizes each moment with complete comic command. She does fine in the monologues but really comes into her own in scenes when Diane has other actors to bounce off. Whether she's explaining why there is no country for gay stars, giving her word \"as an entertainment industry professional,\" or whipping up an 11th-hour match made in \"Access Hollywood\" heaven, Buckley, is an unstoppable force as the uber-agent of anti-change.\rMitchell also shows he's a Hollywood pro at heart when it comes time to doubleteam with Diane to woo and win the trust of a gay playwright who has a hot property they want. The scene remains the dazzling centerpiece of the play, deliciously performed by Buckley and Allen.\rAmanda Perez makes an impressive bow in the more schematically written role of Alex's shallow, shopaholic girlfriend, Ellen. Perez brings a wide-eyed, almost sweet self-centeredness as the party girl from Westchester. \"I wouldn't be able to identify one of my emotions in a police line-up,\" she says, but Perez deftly belies her too-cool \"whatever\" attitude.\rFresh-faced Jordan gives credibility to Mitchell's dream by making his character sharp, confident and appealing. If he doesn't suggest enough of Alex wounds to make his struggle with his sexuality -- as well as his final decision -- more of a bittersweet triumph, he at least makes it understandable.\rHelmer Rob Ruggiero tempers the pace and quips by bringing heart to a play that skirts superficiality.

Smart, droll and dazzling to look at and listen to, writer-director Tony Gilroy's effervescent, intricately plotted puzzler proves in every way superior to his 2007 success \"Michael Clayton.\" The twisty, time jumping narrative forces viewers to keep on their toes, and it could well be that \"Duplicity\" is too smart for its own good as far as the popcorn masses are concerned. Still, this is about as good as it gets these days for sharp-minded Hollywood entertainment made for an intelligent audience, and Universal can only hope that Julia Roberts, in an excellent return to leading lady form, still has the B.O. pull to put this one over.\nAlthough the depredations of the corporate world again lie at the heart of things for Gilroy, this time he has a lot more fun with them, setting the tone with a slap-happy opening credits sequence backgrounded by two titans of industry (Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti) coming to blows in exaggerated slow motion in front of their respective private jets as aghast entourages look on.\nThe stakes are very high here in both love and commerce, the participants are all savvy and hold their cards close, and the winners are those who play the deepest game; who they may be Gilroy craftily keeps a mystery until the very end. In the meantime, there is exceptional pleasure to be taken from watching the consummate pros before and behind the camera play such captivating make-believe with such engaging characters.\nIn a tangy Dubai-set opener that establishes a sexy vibe that never diminishes across two hours, MI6 agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen) insinuates himself into bed with CIA op Claire Stenwick (Roberts). Five years later, in 2008, Ray encounters Claire again in Grand Central Station, but she adamantly insists she doesn't remember him. Over the course of the film, their opening gambit repartee becomes a running gag that assumes different flavors based on the time and place, just one clever invention in a film full of them.\nLured from government work into the far more lucrative world of corporate counter-intelligence, the mutually irresistible lovers plot a scheme by which they will spy for rival firms - Burkett & Randle, headed by Howard Tully (Wilkinson), and Omnikrom, led by Dick Garsik (Giamatti) - and hope to make off with enormously profitable secrets. Triggering such an opportunity is a procured handwritten letter revealing B&R's imminent announcement of a bombshell product guaranteed to generate giant profits. But both its nature and formula must be obtained for the discovery to be any use to either Omnikrom or the two moles.\nClaire and Ray understand one another perfectly: They both know neither will ever meet a more suitable match, but they also have every reason not to trust the other; Claire pulls a fast one on Ray on their initial tryst, while Ray, among other deceptions, unsettles Claire by seducing a vulnerable office drone (a terrific Carrie Preston) to procure vital information. Neither wants to be the first to show weakness by uttering an incontrovertible truth, or by confessing love for the other.\nAll this game playing provides Gilroy with the opportunity to refashion the urbane, snappy repartee of 1930s romantic comedies in a darker, harder edged contemporary context. By pulling off this high-wire act, he shows himself to be one of the few current writers who could possibly have held his own in the august company of his stage-and-newspaper-trained forebears. His dialogue has snap, rhythm and wit, and all the actors in the picture show their appreciation by making it sing or sting, as the occasion requires.\nWith knowledge no doubt acquired in part while toiling on the three \"Bourne\" features, Gilroy juices the drama with a dazzling array of surveillance techniques the two companies use to pry into the other's business; whether they're true or not, they're entirely credible in context, as is the unreserved corporate avarice that audiences will more eagerly swallow today than they might have even a year ago. \nThe screenplay shuffles the chronological deck -- the action perpetually shifts to \"2 Years Ago,\" \"10 Days Earlier,\" and so on -- in ways that only a complete physical exam could prove to be necessary rather than whimsical. But what the calendar jumbling does accomplish is to provide a nice cyclical pattern to the intimate scenes between the romantic leads, which keeps the sexual heat turned up in the midst of so much devious plotting and derring-do. No matter where in the world the action takes them - settings include Rome, Switzerland, the Bahamas, Miami, London, San Diego and Cleveland in addition to New York and Dubai - Claire and Ray always find a time and place to jump-start their romance, which provides an emotional core to parallel the film's intellectual assessment of corporate mischief.\nOn the surface, \"Duplicity\" is escapist fare fronted by beautiful stars wearing gorgeous clothes in chic locations made to look extra-alluring by Robert Elswit's shimmering camerawork. But these are routine qualities compared to some of the other levels on which the film excels, most notably in its adroit synthesis of pulsing drama, bright humor, heady romance, unapologetic maturity, zero tolerance for fools and cheeky awareness of its rejiggered conventions. \nReteamed after working together in \"Closer\" (2004), Roberts and Owen manifest excellent chemistry. An ultra-competent control freak, Claire is a woman almost impossible to surprise or impress, and Roberts' stature feeds into these traits. Her glances and glacial stare-downs rep some of her best moments here, but she's also very good at recalibrating Claire's degree of toughness when Ray demonstrates he can match her at her own game. \nAs for Owen, this reps a very welcome rebound from the similarly globe-trotting \"The International,\" where he was locked into a state of unrelieved grubbiness and anger. Here, he looks debonair (certain moments suggest what he might have been like as James Bond) and keeps a sensitive finger on his co-star's pulse, which serves to quicken his own.\nAside from Wilkinson and Giamatti, both delicious as kings of industry whose egos and ambitions know no bounds, supporting cast has been adroitly filled out with moderately familiar faces that have the virtue of not popping up several times a year in movies or on TV.\nFilm's craftsmanship is of the highest level, from Kevin Thompson's production design that complements the locations in evoking many settings and Albert Wolsky's always flattering costume design to a vibrant, nicely spiced score by James Newton Howard. As neither the shooting nor the editing trade in trendy jitters or jumpiness, one wobbly hand-held shot stands out like a black eye. In every respect, \"Duplicity\" is a film made with total assurance and savoir faire.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 64.238434, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "sections": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "tags": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "body": "An ultra-sophisticated love story between two corporate spies with pronounced mutual trust issues, &quot;<em>Duplicity</em>&quot; is a brainy, non-violent &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith,&quot; the film &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; wanted to be, a &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; for modern times.

Forster never married, and why would he? The author of \u201cMaurice\u201d and \u201cHowards End\u201d was gay, reportedly maintaining relations with a much-younger police officer over the span of four decades. That man did marry, and history has it that his wife knew their secret. In \u201cMy Policeman,\u201d this unconventional arrangement lends itself quite nicely to one of those slightly stuffy yet respectable period pieces of the kind that Ismail Merchant and James Ivory have made of Forster\u2019s novels, jumping back and forth in time between the sexy stuff (featuring Harry Styles, fully embracing the ambiguity of his queerbaiting brand) and the maudlin way it resolves itself so many years later.\n\n\n\nIt all starts with a special delivery to a dreary seaside cottage: An invalid arrives at the house of retired policeman Tom (Linus Roache) and his schoolteacher wife Marion (Gina McKee). It was her idea to take in the unpleasant and largely uncooperative Patrick Hazelwood (Rupert Everett, all but unrecognizable), whose presence clearly annoys her husband. Tom wants nothing to do with this troublesome old acquaintance, disappearing for long walks while Marion deals with his demands.\n\n\n\nApart from reuniting \u201cThe Wings of the Dove\u201d stars Everett and Roache, the contemporary framing device does little but slow down the flow of livelier \u2014 and sometimes downright hot-blooded \u2014 flashbacks, when Tom (Styles) and Marion (Emma Corrin) were first married, and they spent a lot of time hanging out with Tom\u2019s more cultured friend Patrick (David Dawson), a museum curator and dabbling artist. Patrick looks to be about a decade older than Tom (Forster had 23 years on his beloved bobby), and though Marion\u2019s worldly enough to sense that he might be funny that way, she doesn\u2019t suspect her boyfriend of being his lover.\n\n\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia\u201d writer Ron Nyswaner\u2019s script \u2014 which he adapted from the novel by Bethan Roberts, with Michael Grandage (\u201cGenius\u201d) directing \u2014 shapes this mystery somewhat strangely, since audiences presumably know this is a love-triangle intrigue going in, and Marion harbors some guilt for her role in what happened (so she mustn\u2019t be completely oblivious), but the filmmakers still want there to be a sense of surprise and discovery as they peel the artichoke one leaf at a time. To that end, modern-day Marion gives herself permission to snoop through Patrick\u2019s possessions, discovering old diaries that corroborate what she\u2019s always suspected about him, including glimpses into what life was like for homosexuals at the time \u2014 meeting in clubs, hooking up in back alleys, risking arrest or assault if they\u2019re caught.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Policeman\u201d comes alive during its 1950s-set segments, focusing first on the origins of Tom and Marion\u2019s relationship before diving even deeper into the past to reveal how Patrick got there first, hitting the deliciously innocent young cop with the line, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m an amateur artist.\u201d When Tom shows up a short time later to be sketched, he\u2019s wearing his full uniform \u2014 but not for long. Patrick follows his lead (it\u2019s Tom who makes the first move), and the ensuing sex scenes are tender yet genuine, and they don\u2019t skimp on the nudity, which is somewhat surprising, since the film seems to have been made for audiences who identify with Marion more than either of these men.\n\n\n\nWhat gives that away? Well, so much of the film is told from her point of view, and even the flashbacks \u2014 which are fleshed out (so to speak) by what she reads in Patrick\u2019s journals \u2014 reflect the naivete with which their marriage began. At the time, Tom struck her as very shy. He\u2019s terribly awkward and not at all enthusiastic in bed (with her). But he proposes marriage, and this feels like the life she wanted, even if it\u2019s all a bit much when Patrick shows up during their honeymoon to cook them a meal and confront Tom in the shed. One of Marion\u2019s friends clearly knows the score, giving the camera a conspiratorial look during the wedding (in a satisfyingly didactic scene that comes later, we learn that she\u2019s a lesbian).\n\n\n\nThe present-day portion of \u201cMy Policeman\u201d is all about what remains unresolved, like the movie \u201cAtonement\u201d with much drearier everything: The sets, costumes and so forth are all perfectly appropriate for the period, just a bit more mothlike and gray than we might want. Alas, the older actors don\u2019t have all that much to do (editor Chris Dickens keeping cutting back to McKee reading), but the younger trio are strong, albeit restrained, in their roles. Corrin, so great as a wife betrayed in \u201cThe Crown\u201d (they played Princess Diana), could do this role in their sleep, while Styles has the tricky task of making Tom\u2019s betrayal feel tragic for all involved.\n\n\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s probably for the best that Roberts decided to fictionalize everything, rather than treating this as Forster\u2019s actual story. Doing so allows the novelist to focus on the poetry of her interpretation rather than the psychology of how relationships actually work. Whether its \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d or \u201cMy Policeman,\u201d the trouble with straight women writing gay love stories is that they tend to conflate sex and romance \u2014 that is, they think of them as love stories \u2014 while treating bisexuality as a threat, as opposed to a liberating identity unto itself. There are a lot of people out there who have wives and children at home and lovers on the side (same-sex or otherwise), and this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re unfulfilled. They may, in fact, be more satisfied than those in heteronormative relationships.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cMy Policeman,\u201d Marion assumes that her husband has always preferred Patrick to herself, and that it would be an act of love on her part to reunite them. For any nonstandard arrangement to work, however, communication is key. Rather than dictating the terms in the climactic scene, she might have saved them both a lot of trouble by having a conversation. Keep the Kleenex within reach \u2014 you\u2019ll still want it. Just know that a more meaningful version of this story would have involved less time reading alone and more talking together.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 59.389446, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "&#x27;My Policeman&#x27; Review: <em>Harry</em> Styles Swings Both Ways as a Bisexual Bobby", "sections": "\u2018My Policeman\u2019 Review: <em>Harry</em> Styles Swings Both Ways as a Bisexual Bobby", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Styles", "body": " Policeman,\u201d this unconventional arrangement lends itself quite nicely to one of those slightly stuffy yet respectable period pieces of the kind that Ismail Merchant and James Ivory have made of Forster\u2019s novels, jumping back and forth in time between the sexy stuff (featuring <em>Harry</em> Styles, fully embracing"}, "id": "631e865c64441fabed102554"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "The Importance of Being Earnest", "Frank Rizzo", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Loeb Drama Center, Cambridge, Mass.; 556 seats; $50 top", "Most Popular", "\u2018Avatar: The Way of Water\u2019 Trailer: James Cameron\u2019s Long-Awaited Sequel Finally Debuts Footage", "Kendrick Lamar Drops New Song, 'The Heart Part 5' \u2014 Video Features the Faces of Kanye West, Will Smith, O.J.

But Ridiculusmus makes Wilde's surreal artifice in the face of reason and morality the very point of its comedy. It's an especially wild approach to the playwright's satire on the hypocrisy of the aristocratic code of conduct.\rHere the aud is a co-conspirator with the performers as they ignore the conventions of society -- not to mention the theater -- in their effort to make clownish anarchy of the twits and wits of class-driven English society.\rThe show brings to mind another cuckoo company: Charles Ludlum's Ridiculous Theater, which took classic genres and twisted them into hilarious comic pretzels. In a way, this could be \"The Mystery of Earnest Vep,\" where the fun is in the outrageous lengths to which a pair of actors go for their comic art.\rBut with Ludlum's \"Irma Vep,\" the source material was far from prime. Here the boys aren't quite in the same camp -- although they do slip into that mode on occasion (especially David Woods' eyebrow-acting Cecily, who sounds like a Valley girl's take on Bette Davis).\rUnlike Ludlum's scattershot comedy, however, Wilde's lines are pure gold and the play's structure, pace and purpose are precise. While landing quite a few Wilde moments, Ridiculusmus misses many as well; on occasion one simply yearns for the real -- not just the surreal -- thing.\rThe men often make up for it in sheer energy, nerve and some delicious between-the-lines playfulness. Still, pushing way past two hours, the forced and crude hilarity often flags and in the end we share the actors' exhaustion.\rHowever, the production introduces us to a pair of terrific talents. The lithe Haynes is upper-crust crisp as Algernon, sublimely frilly as Gwendolyn and a jittery delight as Miss Prism. The towering Woods plays the petulant Jack, the libidinous Cecily and a blase butler. They both share Lady Bracknell's bird-topped chapeau, and when the action gets too fast and furious the actors simply let their petticoats, cutaways and hats do the talking (along with a couple of puppets, dummies and coat racks that serve as stand-ins).\rHelmed by Jude Kelly, it is still an amusing show with moments of inspired lunacy. This romp should find further venues on these shores where auds are likely to welcome a less earnest \"Earnest.\" Others, however, may prefer a tamer Wilde.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 55.01377, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "body": "The delight of <em>duplicity</em> and disguise has always been the comic propellant in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s secretly subversive comedy, but this London import takes it to ridiculous extremes -- mostly to the good -- at ART.\rRidiculusmus -- aka actors David Woods and Jon Haynes -- tackle all the trivial-pursuing"}, "id": "562bcd65c75d075a8c00093d"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Sly Fox", "Frank Rizzo", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Shubert Theater, Boston; 1,650 seats; $88 top", "Most Popular", "Kendrick Lamar Drops New Song, 'The Heart Part 5' \u2014 Video Features the Faces of Kanye West, Will Smith, O.J.

And it provides Richard Dreyfuss with a dazzling comic role. \nThe actor is not alone in showing what old pros can do with golden material. But the production is still finding its way. As of now, it's an uneven exercise, with many delights but also a few duds. Arthur Penn, who smartly staged the original production more than 25 years ago, is again at the helm. He should be able to iron out some remaining problems of casting, character and pacing.\n\"There's nothing like dying,\" says Dreyfuss' Foxwell J. Sly, a scoundrel businessman in late 19th century San Francisco (George C. Scott originated the role). Sly is pretending to be on a first-name basis with the Grim Reaper in order to con fortunes from fools who think they will inherit it all when the old boy croaks.\nDreyfuss, in full devilish gusto, exults in playing the mastermind. He's a Duddy Kravitz for the Gold Rush era, a man who delights in outratting the rats, and gets his joie de vivre from swindling. It's hard to resist the appeal of Dreyfuss waxing eloquently about his love of gold as if he were lusting after a beautiful woman. He does that, too, to hilarious effect, at the end of the first act. (Oddly, the beneath-the-nightshirt encounter is more pseudo than sexual in this production than it is in the original script.)\nSly is assisted in his scheming by his indebted servant Able (Eric Stoltz), the major-domo who orchestrates the cons at Sly's behest and learns at the master's knee. \"Play people, not poker,\" Sly advises. Stoltz helps keeps the action moving but hasn't yet imbued the character with any spark. The savory final moments of the play don't quite catch fire.\nBetter at matching Dreyfuss greed for greed, take for take, is the trio of vultures that come calling at Sly's sickbed in hopes of making it into his will. Bob Dishy, accountant Abner Truckle in the original production, reprises the role here and is just as terrific. Rene Auberjonois has delicious fun as a doddering, decrepit old man. Bronson Pinchot, as Lawyer Craven, is often amusing, even if he hasn't yet found a special sleaze of his own.\nNick Wyman does nicely as Crouch's outraged naval officer son. Peter Scolari has a few shameless moments as the frustrated chief of police. In a delightful bit of casting, \"Professor\" Irwin Corey shines in the running gag of the world's slowest court clerk, when Sly finally has his judgment day. (In a fun bit of double casting, Dreyfuss also gets to play the Wild West justice, with cowboy fervor.)\nLess successful are Rachel York as a prostitute who wants to marry Sly and Elizabeth Berkley as Truckle's virginal wife. Berkley mostly fails to mine the comic gold lining the script. (An absurdly funny reference to \"chastity shoes\" misses its mark.)\nAt the Boston opening night, the production lacked the snap of a well-oiled comic machine. Sloppy slapstick needs to be cleaned up, and comic relationships are still to be discovered. Most of all, the ensemble needs to come together. Right now, the audience is watching a series of individual comic riffs, some brilliant, some promising, some simply flat.\nClearly, there's much work to be done before the show goes to Broadway. Right now, Dreyfuss' heady tornado of a performance keeps the evening on course. But with care, the potential is there for this comedy to rightfully claim its place as an American classic.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 54.934505, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "body": "Greed is not only good, it&#x27;s downright hysterical in the Broadway-bound revival of Larry Gelbart&#x27;s farce &quot;Sly Fox.&quot; Gelbart&#x27;s literately low script, based loosely on Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone,&quot; is a love letter to avarice, a valentine to <em>duplicity</em>.

And with barely a pause, he\u2019s off again, beginning a European tour next month that comes back to the States for three months in the fall. Harry fans\u2019 cups runneth over.\r\n\r\nStill, Friday night was the first time he\u2019d ever be performing most of the new album before a live audience, so the sense of an event was palpable, and for many felt like a secret privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d is a departure, and performing an entire brand-new album, even before an adoring crowd, is a doubtless nerve-wracking challenge. Added to that, it\u2019s a more intimate album than \u201cFine Line,\u201d its flamboyant predecessor, and many of its lilting, breezy songs aren\u2019t fodder for an outsized stadium tour. Styles, dressed in a Gucci t-shirt and leather slacks, seemed slightly nervous as he and his tightly drilled band rolled through the first few songs of the album \u2014 in order \u2014 strolling from the synthy hook of the album\u2019s current hit single, \u201cAs It Was,\u201d to tender offerings like \u201cMatilda\u201d and the light \u00a0funk of tracks like \u201cDaydreaming\u201d and \u201cCinema.\u201d The fans roared in approval and many sang along in places, but they'd first heard most of the songs less than 24 hours earlier.\r\n\r\nStyles rarely spoke to the crowd during the first few songs, but loosened up as the evening progressed. \u201cHow are we doing so far?\u201d he asked during one of several digressions where he spoke of how much the album means to him, how it\u2019s the product of \u201ceverything we\u2019ve all been through, collectively and as individuals, over the past two years,\u201d and how pleased and relieved he is to finally have it out in the world. \u201cI mean, I like it,\u201d he said of the album. \u201cBut I\u2019m very, very happy that you like it so far.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he did at Coachella, Styles was accompanied by three of his female bandmembers for \u201cBoyfriends,\u201d the penultimate track on the album, for some close harmonies over acoustic guitars. The style of song is new for him \u2014 a slow, contemplative and serious ballad \u2014\u00a0but its lyrics are clearly aimed at the heartstrings of his core fan base: The song is \u201cfor anyone who\u2019s ever had or haven\u2019t had or had any relation to a boyfriend.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the album reached its conclusion, Styles told the crowd he\u2019d be back shortly to play a few more songs, and then closed the main set with the album's final track, \u201cLove of My Life.\u201d He thanked Rob Stringer, the head of his record label, Sony Music. \u201cYou might think I\u2019d hate the head of my record company but I don\u2019t,\u201d he said, and spoke of Stringer\u2019s generosity letting Styles borrow his home to work on the album, and noted that the song had been written there. (That sound you hear is Rob Stringer\u2019s phone ringing, as artists call to ask if they too can borrow his house.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the song\u2019s conclusion, Styles briefly left the stage and then returned to play some older songs. While the preceding 45 minutes had seen a (relatively) lower-key Styles concentrating hard on the new material, the encore was like he\u2019d been let out of his cage. He and the band roared through several of his greatest hits \u2014\u00a0 \u201cAdore You,\u201d \u201cWatermelon Sugar,\u201d \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d his One Direction showcase \u201cWhat Makes You Beautiful,\u201d \u201cKiwi\u201d and even a crowd-singalong reprise of \u201cAs It Was\u201d \u2014 in a seemingly ad-libbed set: at one point, the band seemed confused and vamped on an almost heavy metal riff while Styles ventured out onto the walkways that led from the stage toward the center of the arena for approximately the twentieth time that night. Several times, he seemed to be leaving the stage but came back to play another song, and the crowd roared at the finale as he waved first a Ukrainian flag, and then his usual rainbow-colored one in a statement of solidarity with both.\r\n\r\nThe two halves of the concert \u2014 \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d and the encores of stadium-sized hits \u2014\u00a0presented the differences between his new and old material in stark relief. How he reconciles the two on his months-long forthcoming tour remains to be seen \u2014\u00a0but in the meantime, the ecstatic crowd in New York (along with the millions who\u2019d watched the livestream) left knowing they\u2019d witnessed a historic night in Harrylore.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Jem Aswad.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 46.552395, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Styles Lights Up New York With His \u2018One Night Only\u2019 Performance of \u2018<em>Harry\u2019s</em> House\u2019: Concert Review", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Styles Lights Up New York With His \u2018One Night Only\u2019 Performance of \u2018<em>Harry\u2019s</em> House\u2019: Concert Review", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Styles", "body": "\u201cThis is a very special evening for me, for us,\u201d <em>Harry</em> Styles said to a crowd of nearly 20,000 at the UBS Arena on Friday, and to millions over an Apple Music livestream. \u201cWe\u2019re in New York City for one night only, and we\u2019ll be playing this new album for you the way it was intended to be heard"}, "id": "62891c2b28ccbc465000230e"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Bon Voyage", "Lisa Nesselson", "Latest", "Read More About:", "France", "Most Popular", "Jason Sudeikis 'Had No Prior Knowledge' About Olivia Wilde Being Served on Stage at CinemaCon", "James Cameron\u2019s \u2018Avatar 2\u2019 Debuts Visually Dazzling Footage at CinemaCon, Gets Official Title", "Margot Robbie\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 Sets 2023 Release Date, Unveils First-Look Photo", "Harry Styles and Florence Pugh Get Hot and Heavy in Olivia Wilde's 'Don't Worry Darling' Sneak Peek", "\u2018Walking Dead\u2019 Star Melissa McBride Exits Carol-Daryl Spinoff Series at AMC", "Openly Gay \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 Star Golda Rosheuvel Was Told by a Lesbian Director to Stay in the Closet", "Andrew Garfield Is Taking a Break From Acting After 'Under the Banner of Heaven' to 'Just Be a Bit Ordinary for a While'", "Was Phish\u2019s Madison Square Garden Run a Superspreader Event?

Centered on the hectic days in June 1940 when the French government and privileged classes hightailed it to Bordeaux before Paris fell to the Germans, pic intertwines the fortunes of half-a-dozen colorful main characters all bent on survival amidst constant emotional and political turmoil. Ambitious, multi-layered tale, comfortably awash in old-fashioned gloss and theatrical archetypes, is suspenseful fun from start to finish. Local biz should be brisk and offshore prospects look bright for this first feature by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (\"Cyrano\") since \"The Horseman on the Roof\" (1995).\rPic's strength is its genuinely amusing take on a situation that couldn't have been a barrel of laughs for those who lived through it -- call it the \"Hogan's Heroes\" school of narrative backdrops. Script gets in its digs at French citizens and officials who were only too happy to embrace the Germans; but it mostly concentrates on the ever-shifting reality of its characters' vaudevillesque lives.\rSpoiled, coquettish movie star Viviane (Isabelle Adjani) is the toast of Paris. On the night of her new movie's black-tie premiere, government minister Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu) indicates he's keen on courting her, but she's followed back to her lavish duplex apartment by an obviously disgruntled older man, Andre Arpel (Nicolas Vaude).\rThat same night, Frederic Roger (Gregori Derangere), a handsome, open-faced young man, receives a call at his boarding house. Turns out he and Viviane were once an item, and she now needs his help in disposing of the body of M. Arpel, who, she claims, accidentally fell to his death after she slapped him. Frederic wants to call the police but Viviane is very good at persuading men to do her bidding. Driving the deceased's car in the rain, Frederic crashes into a police call box and the trunk pops, revealing the late M. Arpel to plentiful witnesses.\rFredric's court-appointed lawyer, like all able-bodied men in France, has just been mobilized. Due to ship out the next day, he's convinced he'll be back in plenty of time to plead Frederic's case, as \"this will all be over in three weeks -- nobody wants a war.\" However, the attorney does mention that the stiff died of a gunshot wound. Frederic, who's a budding novelist, passes the time in his cell writing.\rThe day before the Germans are due in Paris, Gallic authorities empty the prisons, handcuffing the inmates in pairs for transfer to the provinces. Well-mannered Frederic is cuffed to resourceful petty criminal Raoul (Yvan Attal) who seizes the opportunity to escape by picking the lock with a fork. Now free, Frederic determines that Viviane has joined the exodus to Bordeaux, and he heads south. On the train, he meets no-nonsense academic Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), an assistant to eminent physicist Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle) of the College de France.\rIn Bordeaux, the elegant Hotel Splendide is packed to the rafters with celebs and aristocrats from Paris. Viviane, who's since shacked up with Beaufort, spots the no-longer-imprisoned Frederic on the street. So begins a frenzied period of jockeying for position and security before France capitulates.\rStorytelling is tight and jaunty, with thesps obviously having a blast. Adjani's Viviane shows a mercenary command of the well-placed sobbing fit that wouldn't have looked out of place in the silent era. Ledoyen scores as a brainy broad who wouldn't mind taking off her glasses for Frederic; and, as the latter, Derangere is enormously appealing as a framed lad who learns to rise to the occasion in perilous times.\rAmong other thesps, Attal is lawless panache personified as Raoul, and Peter Coyote shows up as a well-connected Anglo journalist who has the hots for Viviane. Crowd scenes are impressive, chases and fist fights nicely staged. Gabriel Yared's score is atmospheric but never overbearing. Production design is evocative, and both lensing and editing are aces. In fact, entire package is ultra-pro.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 44.43217, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"sections": "<em>Harry</em> Styles and Florence Pugh Get Hot and Heavy in Olivia Wilde&#x27;s &#x27;Don&#x27;t Worry Darling&#x27; Sneak Peek", "tags": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "body": "A rousing, well-crafted romp packed with ingenuity, <em>duplicity</em>, close calls and heroic gestures, &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; is true to its title.

Regardless, it was a hit and gave the young singer the runway to find his sea legs as a solo artist \u2014 and more importantly, a clean slate he could follow with anything he wanted. That ended up being 2019\u2019s more defining and definitive \u201cFine Line\u201d album, which could be considered his true debut, spawning massive singles like \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d and a blockbuster (if pandemic-delayed) tour that segues directly into \u201cHarry\u2019s House,\u201d which is very much a continuation and progression of its predecessor.\r\n\r\nWhich isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s more of the same: \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d is a bit more intimate and less stadium-sized than its predecessor. Lyrically, it\u2019s heavier and more serious in places \u2014 not surprising after everything that\u2019s happened in the two and a half years since \u201cFine Line\u201d dropped just before the pandemic. On a related note, the number of contributing musicians is also much smaller: The album was produced and co-written almost entirely with longtime collaborators Kid Harpoon (Jessie Ware, Shawn Mendes, Florence & the Machine) and Tyler Johnson (Sam Smith, Cam), and they played most of the instruments as well, although John Mayer and Ben Harper make six-string cameos.\r\n\r\nAfter a peppy start with the horn-speckled \u201cMusic in a Sushi Restaurant\u201d and the \u201880s-flavored \u201cLate Night Talking,\u201d the album eases into a loose, unhurried groove, mixing up the moods and tempos but never getting too relaxed: Just when you\u2019re leaning back, a song like the effortlessly joyful lead single, \u201cAs It Was\u201d (which has already topped the charts in multiple countries) bursts through like the sun after a summer downpour.\r\n\r\nThe songs are largely about romance and sex, but turn darker when seemingly addressed to specific people or situations. \u201cDaylight\u201d is loaded with drug references, \u201cMatilda\u201d is for someone with a troubled family history, and the gorgeous \u201cBoyfriends\u201d \u2014 premiered at Coachella last month \u2014 is for a friend in a toxic relationship: Styles sings \u201cYou love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin,\u201d accompanied only by Harper on acoustic guitars and his own impressively multitracked harmonies. But it\u2019s not all serious, either: There\u2019s also the laid-back, Timberlakeian funk of \u201cCinema,\u201d the Beatlesy \u201cGrapejuice\u201d and a lovely ballad called \u201cLittle Freak.\u201d\r\n\r\nSix and a half years after Harry Styles took his final bow with One Direction, it\u2019s possible to imagine a sizable portion of his audience has no memory of his time with the group that vaulted him to stardom. And at 28, no longer so young, he\u2019s built himself an enviable solo career that \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d goes a long way toward furthering.\r\n\r\n\u00a0", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 41.34369, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Styles Moves Smoothly Into His Next Era With the Intimate &#x27;<em>Harry&#x27;s</em> House&#x27;: Album Review", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Styles Moves Smoothly Into His Next Era With the Intimate \u2018<em>Harry\u2019s</em> House\u2019: Album Review", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Styles", "body": "Just over five years ago, <em>Harry</em> Styles dropped a solo debut that absolutely no one saw coming, especially from a guy who had closed the door on his role as lead heartthrob in pop juggernaut One Direction only 18 months earlier. \u201c<em>Harry</em> Styles\u201d was a timeless, oddly genre-less album that sounded"}, "id": "6287114ee7b9d2001a4b680b"}, {"sections": ["\u2018Don\u2019t Worry Darling\u2019 Review: Florence Pugh and Harry Styles Sizzle in Olivia Wilde\u2019s Neo-\u201950s Nightmare Thriller, but the Movie Is More Showy Than Convincing", "Owen Gleiberman", "Latest", "Read More About:", "<p>Reviewed at Warner Bros.

Yet it would be hugely unfair to allow this tempest in a teapot of gossipy turmoil to influence one\u2019s feelings about the movie. If you want to talk about problems related to \"Don\u2019t Worry Darling,\" you need look no further than at what\u2019s onscreen.\n\n\n\nThe film, written by Katie Silberman, with the brilliant production design of Katie Byron, is a kind of candy-colored \u201cStepford Wives\u201d in the Twilight Zone meets \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d for the age of torn-at-the-seams democracy. In theory, this should add up to a juicy watch. Wilde, whose first feature was the witty and vivacious 2019 girls-on-a-bender comedy \"Booksmart\" (this is her second film), is a gifted director who knows how to set a mood. In \"Don\u2019t Worry Darling,\" she does that to the max, and for a while you get caught up in it (or, at least, I did). Between the pop ambition, the tasty dream visuals, and the presence of Harry Styles in his first lead role, \"Don\u2019t Worry Darling\" should have no trouble finding an audience. But the movie takes you on a ride that gets progressively less scintillating as it goes along.\n\n\n\nAs it opens, we hear the sexy bop of Ray Charles\u2019 1958 version of \"Night Time Is the Right Time,\" and we\u2019re plunged into what looks like a cocktail party from the \"Mad Men\" era, except that everyone is so loud and garish and lewd and hyped that you wonder if the Gibson martinis are spiked with Ecstasy. This is not what cocktail parties were like back then. But that\u2019s because this is not back then. It is now.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re in a strange planned community somewhere in a palm-tree desert, where every home is the exact same white flat cookie-cutter model (they look like something Frank Lloyd Wright would have designed for IKEA). Each morning, the men get into their big curvy postwar cars, which are in different lollipop shades, and exit their suburban cul-de-sac in a choreographed line. They\u2019re headed for another day\u2019s work on the Victory Project, a research operation so top secret they\u2019re not even allowed to talk about it with their wives. The standard corporate line is that they\u2019re working on \"the development of progressive materials,\" which makes it sound like they\u2019re inventing nuclear weapons or something every bit as dark and monumental. (Every so often, an explosive underground hum will shake and rattle those mid-century-modern living rooms.)\n\n\n\nAnd the women? They stay home, chatting and backbiting, cleaning house, looking after the kids, hanging out at the pool, preparing tuna salad and deviled eggs, taking ballet classes, and greeting their husbands with a drink at the door. You may survey it all and think: What fresh hell is this? But \"Don\u2019t Worry Darling\" hasn\u2019t even gotten to the sinister part yet. The name of this surreal retro subdivision is Victory, and the main thing everyone talks about is how wonderful it is. How lucky they are to be there, and how happy they are to have escaped the life they had before.\n\n\n\nOur entry point into the Victory lifestyle is a childless couple who look singularly sexy, appealing, and in love: Jack, played by Styles with a wholesome cunning that marks him as a natural screen actor, and Alice, played by Florence Pugh, who holds down the center of the movie with a spark of eagerness that melts into a wary detective\u2019s gaze. These two can hardly keep their hands off each other (early on, she clatters her dinner roast onto the floor, so that Harry\u2019s Jack can go down on her \u2014 a scene that should sell $5 million worth of opening-weekend tickets right there), and there\u2019s an affection to their interplay. But is it real? Is anything we\u2019re seeing real? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe prefab community of Victory is run by a man named Frank, who also created it, and as played by Chris Pine he has the personality of a New Age cult leader \u2014 not a proto guru from the '50s but one of those smiling fascists of self-actualization, the kind who can kill you with their sensitive positivity. And, of course, the reason for that is that they\u2019re never sincere. They\u2019re trying to get something out of you. They\u2019re \"open\" about everything but their own agenda. Pine gives a delectable performance, but as soon as Alice and Jack join the other residents for a party at Frank\u2019s oversize house, it\u2019s clear something deeply troublesome is at play.\n\n\n\nThe characters in \"Don\u2019t Worry Darling\" have a cult leader because they are, in essence, a cult: contempo folks who've formed a community in which they pretend to live like middle-class '50s drones, and agree never to question anything and to do just what they\u2019re told. Asking questions about what\u2019s really going on, the way Alice starts to, is going to get you in trouble. If the film has a resonance, and bits and pieces of it do, it's that we\u2019re living in a world today that seems increasingly assembled out of cult psychology: the de facto cult leaders (like Trump), the tribal mindsets that dictate a rigid moral absolutism, the retro fetishization of 1950s values as a prime ideal.\n\n\n\nAlice is gripped by shock-cut hallucinations that are like Busby Berkeley numbers that turn into evil dreams. And things start to happen around her. She pays special attention when Margaret (KiKi Layne), the only Black woman in Victory, stands at the edge of Frank\u2019s pool party, aghast and distraught, and asks, \"Why are we here?\" Alone on a trolley car, Alice watches a propeller plane crash in the desert and runs out to see what happened, going over to the location no woman is supposed to get near: the Victory Project headquarters, which sits atop a dirt mountain like a Bond villain\u2019s lair in the shape of a giant stripped golf ball. She returns wanting to tell everyone what she\u2019s discovered, but she\u2019s treated like Katharine Ross in \"The Stepford Wives\" or Mia Farrow\u2019s Rosemary\u2014 like someone who hasn\u2019t turned into a pod person yet. She\u2019s also a little like Jim Carrey in \"The Truman Show\": She just woke up to the fact that she's living in a hall of mirrors, and therefore she needs to be silenced. The sinister nerd Dr. Collins (Timothy Simons) is sent over to drug her up. Her beloved Jack suddenly starts acting like he\u2019s\u2026one of them.\n\n\n\nOf course, when those other movies came out (even \"The Stepford Wives,\" which was never more than an amusing piece of claptrap), the world was a little less used to this kind of conspiratorial socio thriller. The early scenes of \"Don\u2019t Worry Darling\" are the film's best, but even there it\u2019s hard not to notice the top-heaviness with which the movie telegraphs its own darkness. (It\u2019s not like we watch Chris Pine\u2019s speech and think, \u201cWhat a good dude!\u201d) To really work, the film needed to reel us in slowly, to be insidious and surprising in the way that \"Get Out\" was. Instead, it\u2019s ominous in an obvious way.\n\n\n\nBut it does have a big twist, which I will, of course, not reveal. I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s a blend of \"Squid Game\" and Shyamalan, that it wants to spin your head but may leave you scratching it, and that it\u2019s hooked to Harry Styles being cast, for one section, as a runty unattractive geek, which (surprise) is not exactly convincing. What is convincing is how easily Styles sheds his pop-star flamboyance, even as he retains his British accent and takes over one party scene by dancing as if he were in a '40s musical. There's actually something quite old-fashioned about Styles. With his popping eyes, floppy shock of hair, and saturnine suaveness, he recalls the young Frank Sinatra as an actor. It\u2019s too early to tell where he\u2019s going in movies, but if he wants to he could have a real run in them.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 40.32663, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "&#x27;Don&#x27;t Worry Darling&#x27; Review: Florence Pugh and <em>Harry</em> Styles Sizzle in Olivia Wilde&#x27;s Neo-&#x27;50s Nightmare Thriller, but the Movie Is More Showy Than Convincing", "sections": "\u2018Don\u2019t Worry Darling\u2019 Review: Florence Pugh and <em>Harry</em> Styles Sizzle in Olivia Wilde\u2019s Neo-\u201950s Nightmare Thriller, but the Movie Is More Showy Than Convincing", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Styles", "body": "-on-a-bender comedy &quot;Booksmart&quot; (this is her second film), is a gifted director who knows how to set a mood.

When all was said and done after five hours and 10 minutes, concert's historical importance far outweighed the actual perfs.\nSmith's \"Anthology\" was reissued in 1997 by Smithsonian/Folkways, and it's importance was immediately reflected in its registering the top spot among reissues in the Village Voice's annual critics poll. To folkies, this is a holy grail, just as \"Nuggets\" is to 1960s garage rockers and the \"Complete Robert Johnson\" is to blues fans; a good 90% of the music performed appears on the compilation.\nSmokey Hormel and Bill Frisell, the two guitarists who held together this behemoth with consistently interesting work, led a well-prepared band of horn-woodwind player Ralph Carney, D.J. Bonebrake on drums and alternating bassists Larry Taylor, Adam Dorn and Eric Mingus. Several of them have experience in the bands of Tom Waits, and it showed as they clanged and chugged their way through songs that, when many of us heard them on vinyl decades ago, sounded like recordings of static and scratches with music in the background. Fiddler Richard Greene, a bluegrass legend, was a furtive spark in much of this dark material, and his leading of a string quartet, with a wordlessly cooing female chorus, on Hoyt Ming's brilliant 1928 instrumental \"Indian War Whoop\" was a highlight.\nThe percussion-heavy approach -- even the stringed instruments were thumped -- began with the first tune, Clarence Ashley's \"The House Carpenter,\" performed with a dark melancholy by Todd Rundgren and Robin Holcomb. The better performers used a similar tone as subtext and shaded it one way or the other: Richard Thompson made gripping a wordy number with an assist from fiddler Eliza Carthy; David Johansen, the former New York Dolls leader who now fronts a band called the Harry Smiths, has developed a gritty country blues voice; and Elvis Costello, well, he did his usual acoustic thing. The most often recruited backup singers, the McGarrigle Sisters sang beautifully throughout the night.\nThose who broke away from rendering Smith's work within a simple folk framework had mixed results. Adam Dorn accompanied one of Smith's short films with a composition built of samples, several of which were \"Anthology\" recordings, and composer Philip Glass accompanied three of Smith's shorts with a delightfully hypnotic run on the baby grand. Mary Margaret O'Hara delivered mysterious yelps and hoots over some blues jams in the most tedious part of the night.\nClarinetist Don Byron, accompanied by just bassist Percy Heath and Frisell, brought a lightness to evening with three interludes, the best of which, the Middle Georgia Singing Convention's oddball tune \"The Song of Love,\" was saved for last. The Folksmen, actually Spinal Tap in folkie garb, delivered some much needed humor in the first act with a Kingston Trio-styled goof.\nBeyond Marianne Faithfull, Bob Neuwirth and Glass, few artists put Smith or the music into context or even attempted to explain their personal connection to a number. Garth Hudson ended the evening at 1:15 a.m. with a rambling multi-genre'd jam on the Royce organ. A quite fitting conclusion.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 33.79119, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "Hal Willner&#x27;s <em>Harry</em> Smith Project", "sections": "Hal Willner\u2019s <em>Harry</em> Smith Project", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Smith", "body": "A parade of known musicians performed little-known songs Wednesday in a marathon attempt to shed some light on the genius of record producer and experimental filmmaker <em>Harry</em> Smith, the man best known for compiling, during the 1950s, 84 pre-Depression recordings that became the &quot;Anthology"}, "id": "562c31e10cc37f50df000053"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Robert Hofler", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Irish Repertory Theater; 137 seats; $40 top", "Most Popular", "Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney Expected to Exit \u2018SNL\u2019", "Vomit, Poop and Woody Harrelson: \u2018Triangle of Sadness\u2019 Shocks Cannes With Uproarious Eight-Minute Standing Ovation", "Halsey Claims Label \u2018Won\u2019t Let Me\u2019 Release New Song \u2018Unless They Can Fake a Viral Moment on TikTok\u2019", "How 'SNL' Said Goodbye to Kate McKinnon, Pete Davidson, Aidy Bryant, and Kyle Mooney", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him (EXCLUSIVE)", "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u2019 Trailer Teases Tom Cruise\u2019s Biggest Stunts Ever", "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 4 Is the Show at Its Biggest, Broadest and Most Emblematic of Netflix\u2019s Evolution: TV Review", "Mick Jagger on Harry Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "John Mulaney Draws Criticism for Having Dave Chappelle Open, Tell \u2018Transphobic Jokes\u2019 at Ohio Show", "Johnny Depp\u2019s Agent Says His Star Power \u2018Dimmed\u2019 Due to On-Set Behavior", "Must Read", "Kendrick Lamar's 'Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers' Bows at No. 1 With Year\u2019s Biggest First-Week Debut", "\u2018Holy Spider\u2019 Review: A Taut, True-Crime Procedural Tangled in the Wicked Web of Iranian Patriarchy", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him", "Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve on Lea Seydoux Starrer 'One Fine Morning;' Clip Unveiled", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "The xx\u2019s Oliver Sim Reveals He\u2019s Been Living With HIV Since Age 17 in Moving \u2018Hideous\u2019 Video", "Tom Cruise Showed Off His Ultra-Thin Vacheron Constantin Overseas at This Year\u2019s Cannes Festival", "MLS Marketing Arm Extends Deal With Mexican National\u00a0Team", "The Best Mattress Bags Protect Your Pieces in Storage and During Moves", "Ratings: NCIS: LA and S.W.A.T.

Four musical stage incarnations recently roamed the regional theaters. Straight plays (no pun intended) adapted from the novel appear to be somewhat rarer. The Variety archives lists only one, circa 1966.\nJoe O'Byrne's \"Dorian Gray\" is the latest, and it is the kind of too-faithful-to-the-source adaptation that exemplifies why Wilde, best known for his plays, opted for a more expansive literary form for this tale. Fortunately, O'Byrne's inventive direction often takes liberties that arrest the eye just when your ear has tuned out the text.\nWilde's only novel, published in 1891, preceded his first great stage success, \"Lady Windermere's Fan,\" by a year. When his publisher thought a somewhat longer novel would sell better, Wilde promptly padded \"Dorian Gray\" with a few new chapters. The result is a sometimes meandering parable on man's incapability to lead life based on aestheticism. The novel never quite matches the brilliance of his concept -- the portrait that ages and grows corrupt while its subject remains unadulterated by the passage of time and the accumulation of his sins.\nOnstage, paintings always pose a bit of a problem. They inspire contemplative, reactive responses better suited to the movies. O'Byrne solves this problem by turning the demons represented in the increasingly befouled painting into a chorus of fairly horny extras who get it on whenever the beautiful Dorian gazes at the ugliness of his soul in paint.\nThis chorus occasionally joins the constantly roving narrator, aka Shadow One, in helping to tell the tale. It isn't a particularly complicated story, but Dorian does get around, traveling from London's better drawing rooms and gardens to some of the city's more intriguing waterfront pubs and dens of iniquity. Unfortunately, the wealth of narration is such that the play often resembles a reading more than an unfolding drama.\nO'Byrne squeezes in all of Wilde's witticisms, lifted directly from the pages of the novel, at the expense of dramatic drive. More significant, he bogs down Dorian Gray's first romantic attachment, the actress Sybil Vane (Tertia Lynch), by spending too much stage time with her mother, Mrs. Vale (Angela Pierce), a character of no apparent consequence.\nThe relationship of note here, of course, is that of the two men, Dorian and his intellectual seducer, Lord Henry (Daniel Pearce). The latter is an absentee Mephistopheles, and O'Byrne has him disappear for far too long after he sets his Adonis disciple to contemplating the art of his own face.\nAs Lord Henry, Pearce's way with an epigram is a bit precious. In contrast with the film's Hatfield, who gave one of the screen's great non-performances, Crispin Freeman is more demonstrative and closer to the excessively romantic figure in the novel, who \"cried\" more often than he \"said\" anything.\nElsewhere, it's difficult to judge the performances. O'Byrne overloads his play with so many scenes that characters come and go before his actors have had a chance to register. An exception is Andrew Seear's exquisitely rendered profile of anguish as Dorian's portraitist, Basil.\nAs a director of stage pictures, O'Byrne establishes a surer, not to mention a more fanciful, footing. Japanese influences dominated the graphic arts of the 1890s, and it is entirely appropriate that he populates his stage here with shrouded puppeteers from Bunraku, masks from Noh and choral elements from Kabuki.\nBob Flanagan's masks borrow from Bosch and various episodes of \"The Twilight Zone.\" Designers Akira Yoshimura and Rebecca Vary provide two levels and several windows, through which much of the action unfolds at a tantalizing distance. Top honors on the production side must go to Brian Nason's inventive lighting design, as when Freeman's extravagant hair casts a long shadow that renders the face of Dorian completely unfathomable.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 33.790154, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"sections": "Mick Jagger on <em>Harry</em> Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Bosch"}, "id": "562c2c6ce621f46c45000013"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Recess: School\u2019s Out", "Todd McCarthy", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney Expected to Exit \u2018SNL\u2019", "Vomit, Poop and Woody Harrelson: \u2018Triangle of Sadness\u2019 Shocks Cannes With Uproarious Eight-Minute Standing Ovation", "Halsey Claims Label \u2018Won\u2019t Let Me\u2019 Release New Song \u2018Unless They Can Fake a Viral Moment on TikTok\u2019", "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u2019 Trailer Teases Tom Cruise\u2019s Biggest Stunts Ever", "How 'SNL' Said Goodbye to Kate McKinnon, Pete Davidson, Aidy Bryant, and Kyle Mooney", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him (EXCLUSIVE)", "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 4 Is the Show at Its Biggest, Broadest and Most Emblematic of Netflix\u2019s Evolution: TV Review", "John Mulaney Draws Criticism for Having Dave Chappelle Open, Tell \u2018Transphobic Jokes\u2019 at Ohio Show", "Mick Jagger on Harry Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "\u2018Moonage Daydream\u2019 Trailer Unveils Dazzling David Bowie Footage Ahead of Cannes Premiere", "Must Read", "Kendrick Lamar's 'Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers' Bows at No. 1 With Year\u2019s Biggest First-Week Debut", "\u2018Holy Spider\u2019 Review: A Taut, True-Crime Procedural Tangled in the Wicked Web of Iranian Patriarchy", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him", "Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve on Lea Seydoux Starrer 'One Fine Morning;' Clip Unveiled", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "\u2018Illegal Abduction\u2019: Portland Protester Sues Feds For Snatching Her Off the Street", "Rick Ross Showcased Hundreds of Rare Cars and Bikes at a Show Held at His Georgia Estate", "MLS Marketing Arm Extends Deal With Mexican National\u00a0Team", "10 Best Antibacterial Body Washes to Get Really Your Skin Clean", "TVLine Items: Taran Killam Rom-Com, Station 19 Vet's New Role and More", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "Recess: School's Out", "type": "Article", "tags": "Harry Bosch", "post_id": 1200466740, "external_id": "7b5ec150427bb2faf2e3f1fbce353d16844792f5", "content_type": "Article", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/rrecess.jpg?w=250", "url": "https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/recess-school-s-out-1200466740/", "published_at": "2001-02-15T23:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2018-06-01T03:44:22Z", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Todd McCarthy", "popularity": 1, "body": "\"Recess: School's Out\" looks exactly like what it is, a bigscreen version of a TV show. This spinoff of \"Disney's Recess\" naturally will generate some initial biz based on the small-fry following for the highly rated ABC Saturday morning series, but it should be expected to follow in the forgettable footsteps of the studio's previous TV-to-feature transfer, \"Doug's 1st Movie,\" which generated a worldwide gross of just $22.8 million two years back. A lucrative playdate awaits on homevid.\nProduced by Walt Disney Television, this innocuous item about a group of playground pals who thwart the evil-doings of a megalomaniacal educator reps, from a theatrical p.o.v., a degradation of the Disney name. What decades of careful brand-name nurturing have led the public to expect -- accomplished animation and original music, for starters -- is tossed aside here in favor of utterly flat backgrounds, a minimum of character detailing and a banal greatest-hits selection of late-'60s rock songs.\nMoppets already keyed into the personalities of the six fourth-graders from Third Street School will slide right into this story of how the kids play spies during summer vacation. Distraught over his friends' departure for various camps, plucky T.J. begins noticing weird green light beaming out of the school building. Natch, adults laugh off his claims, but when he convinces Principal Prickly to take a look, the latter is mysteriously vaporized, prompting T.J. to reassemble his crew, sneak into the school and, ultimately, save the nation's children from a life of eternal recess deprivation.\nIt won't be spoiling things for anyone to reveal that the roots of the evil here lie back in the heyday of hippiedom, when young Prickly squashed the plans of ultra-cool rival educator Benedict to eradicate recess from the school day at Third Street School. It's taken three decades, but Benedict, now a national figure, has finally figured out how to extract revenge: Place a giant laser under a retractable roof at the school and beam it at the moon to alter its orbit, thereby obliterating summer from the calendar and obviating the need for vacation.

Although peppered with tantalizingly salty-mouthed anecdotes and wry observations on aging, sexuality, outsider status and the art of performance, the film is hampered by its overly fannish tone, too dazzled by the self-described \"octogenarian motherf\u2014er\" to be able to meet her own forthright, iconoclastic, penetrating gaze without looking quickly away again.\r\n\r\nA striking, blue-tinged extreme-shallow-focus closeup on Dukakis' fantastic face, that brings out both the age lines and the luminosity of her skin, teases a much more intimate and impressionistic approach than is taken. Soon John Ryan Johnson and Federico Cesca's photography settles into a more familiar and anonymous handheld v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, as we follow Dukakis from home to hotel room to car, from the unveiling ceremony for her Hollywood Walk of Fame Star, to her stint as Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride parade, to her trip to her family's ancestral hometown on the Greek island of Lesbos.\r\n\r\nDukakis has lived such a storied life \u2014 interior as well as exterior \u2014 that the challenge here was always going to be corralling it all into a coherent narrative. She is a first-generation Greek immigrant who set up her own theater company in New Jersey rather than be sidelined and stereotyped by the East Coast theater establishment due to her ethnicity. Who was, for a good period before meeting her husband Louis Zorich, the \"queen of the one-night-stand\" and who retains still a healthily irreverent attitude toward sex (\"You take a hard pr\u2014 for granted,\" she says wistfully, \"but then the day comes and you can't take for granted a hard pr\u2014\"). Who won an Oscar for \"Moonstruck\" the same year her cousin Michael became the Democratic nominee for U.S. President. And who went on to earn LGBTQ icon status playing the matriarch of the epochal 1993 miniseries \"Tales of the City,\" embodying one of the first transgender television characters to make an impression on mainstream American consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"Olympia\" cannot but sporadically entertain, touching as it does on all these events, sometimes in interview and sometimes in home movie or archive footage, such as Dukakis getting made up for Oscar night and wondering if Faye Dunaway, staying in the same hotel, might be able to lend her some eyelash glue. But for every insightful, witty or spiky little detail there's an unnecessarily banal inclusion, such as Dukakis getting frustrated with Siri, politely posing for pictures in the supermarket, or, in an ironically unilluminating sequence, negotiating lighting cues during an onstage soliloquy.\r\n\r\nA clutch of celebrity interviewees \u2014 including Laura Linney, Whoopi Goldberg, Lynn Cohen and Diane Ladd \u2014 are also largely wasted, whittled down to adulatory but oddly impersonal soundbites in tribute to Dukakis' professionalism and talent. Most of the participants tend to be much more revealing about their relationship to Dukakis in candid moments than they are in the interviews conducted for the film. And sometimes the questions put directly to Dukakis herself feel awkward: \"Were you very sexual?\" an off-camera Mavromichalis asks. \"Was Louis very sexual? Was he more sexual than you? Does it ever stop, being sexual?\" After a while such queries sound less like frank conversation and more like prurience.\r\n\r\nNot that Dukakis herself is not game. She has a lovely thoughtful response to Mavromichalis' \"fear of death\" question, and is always ready with a disarmingly dirty observation about sex. But a more skillful interviewer would have got to these moments organically, and once there, would push beyond the first punchline. Sometimes we teeter on the edge of breakthrough, such as when she talks about motherhood, or past drug use or suicidal tendencies, only for the scene to switch before we get to close that circle. It's only during the finale, as Dukakis returns to Greece amid a sort of spiritual reawakening that we get a glimpse at the richer, more meaningful, if also perhaps more difficult profile this could have been.\r\n\r\nTiming, too, is an issue. \"Olympia\" was largely shot during the Obama administration, when Dukakis was in her early 80s (she is now 89), and indeed the film premiered nearly two years ago, in late 2018. And so many of the specific challenges she faced so fearlessly \u2014 sexist double standards, bias against immigrants, being regarded as \"too ethnic\", trans representation, ageism \u2014 have come to the center of the cultural conversation in the years since the film wrapped, and it's frustrating that we don't get her outspoken, sailor-blushingly profane take on them now. But trapped in the amber of a recent past that also feels like a century ago, and uncertain whether its purpose is to mythologize or de-mythologize its sharp, steely subject, \"Olympia\" for all its fondness, is just too cursory a portrait of a complex woman: depth presented as a series of glinting surfaces.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 31.890156, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Mavromichalis", "body": "Less interesting subjects than Olympia Dukakis have been profiled in more compelling documentaries than <em>Harry</em> Mavromichalis\u2019 &quot;Olympia,&quot; a fervently admiring but scattered and sometimes scatty portrait of a woman who is anything but.

These powers were vested in him by the superstar status of One Direction, which with each passing month sets new records for longest hiatus ever, even as its members meander in multiple directions. The most satisfying of these detours has been Styles\u2019 full immersion in an era that predates him by a few generations, the mellow gold of the 1970s, which, when he released his eponymous solo debut two and a half years ago, made for quite an interesting dichotomy between his fan base and his bank of influences. It was, essentially, Dad-rock for girls. You remember that saying about the men not knowing, but the little girls understanding? Well, the men would have gotten Styles\u2019 initial solo music just fine, if any of them had shown up for the shows. The seats were filled anyway.\r\n\r\nCome Styles\u2019 second album, the question was: Would he chicken out and play more directly to his target demo? \u201cSign of the Times\u201d was not quite the No. 1 hit everyone thought it would be; that can happen with six-minute ballads that sound like Nilsson, in the late 2010s. You could also raise the more cynical question of whether the \u201870s influence was a trendy coat he borrowed from his older co-writer/producers, to be discarded as easily as whatever that black lace getup was that he wore to the Met Gala. Suspicions along these lines might have seemed founded when he released a teaser track (not an official single, the record company would like to remind us) called \u201cLights Up,\u201d which was fine, but which sounded faintly\u2026 contemporary. Retro-Harry, we hardly knew ye\u2026?\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to report, then, that, heard as a whole, the \u201cFine Line\u201d album makes almost no sops to sounding like anything else you\u2019ll hear on the radio (unless you're, like, counting SiriusXM\u2019s The Loft). He was so much older then, and he\u2019s still not that much younger-sounding now, as it turns out. The opening track, \u201cGolden,\u201d is probably an ode to a girl, not a state, but as the harmonies kick in alongside the slide guitar, there\u2019s a hint that he\u2019s been keeping spiritual if not literal company in California with Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2014 an influence that becomes more explicit later on in \u201cCanyon Moon,\u201d a happy charmer with some introductory acoustic strumming that inescapably brings to mind \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say that Styles and his collaborators save all their laurels for Cali in this Malibu-recorded collection, because there are plenty of vintage English influences, too. Several of the songs have McCartney-esque interludes, like slightly druggier versions of album tracks he might have released in his fruitful \u201870s solo heyday. (We swear we wrote this observation down in our listening notes before looking up the recent Rolling Stone interview where Styles name-checked Macca's \u201cLondon Town\u201d and said of the interludes in recording sessions: \u201cWe\u2019d do mushrooms, lie down on the grass, and listen to Paul McCartney\u2019s\u00a0\u2018Ram\u2019\u00a0in the sunshine.\u201d) Is it coincidence, or conjuring, that ex-Wings guitarist Laurence Juber pops up on one song? Juber's hit-songwriter daughter, Ilsey Juber, co-wrote a track on the album, so that's probably the connection \u2014 but you get the feeling that Styles is the kind of guy who totally knows and digs that Juber was a band member on one of his favorite McCartney albums, \"Back to the Egg.\"\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a good degree of crossover with the team that assisted Styles on his previous album, with Tyler Johnson producing or co-writing on nearly all the tracks, although Jeff Bhusker\u2019s role as collaborator is diminished in the credits and Kid Harpoon\u2019s is elevated. Outsiders are surprisingly few, although star bassist Pino Palladino has been brought in to play the loudest, most McCartney-esque bass you\u2019ve ever heard on the six-minute slow jam \u201cShe,\u201d and the vocal duo Lucius makes a harmonic contribution to the delightfully loopy \u201cTreat People With Kindness\u201d that\u2019s less in their usual soul style than almost Yoko-esque. Styles has kept his team pretty insular here, aside from one guest-starring production turn from Greg Kurstin, who definitely stays in the spirit of things on the dancehall-flavored \u201cSunflower, Vol. 6\u201d by throwing in an electric sitar break.\r\n\r\nYou do get a couple more distinctly modern outliers, besides the heavenly electro-chorale of \u201cLights Up.\u201d The new single (the real one), \u201cAdore You,\u201d have a throbbing beat and a funk rhythm guitar that make it sound like a danceable, easygoing answer song to the ode Taylor Swift supposedly wrote to him, \u201cStyle.\u201d And if you squint, you could imagine it\u2019s Maroon 5 slurping up the \u201cWatermelon Sugar.\u201d But generally his blues, such as they are, are definitely of the bell-bottom variety.\r\n\r\nHow blue is he? Styles has said the album is \u201call about having sex and feeling sad,\u201d but both the sensuality and the melancholy are a little on the muted side, as if he weren\u2019t totally convinced he should be heartbroken over the breakup the record is supposed to be largely about. (Clues as to which woman he might be referring to get pretty obvious when he has distinctly French-accented female dialogue looped in at the end of \u201cCherry.\u201d) It\u2019s more an album about romantic ambivalence, really, which is a perfectly fine subject for a 25-year-old who\u2019s still sowing some oats to settle in on.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need to be ambivalent about \u201cFine Line,\u201d though. If he\u2019s not necessarily ready to play the hero in a relationship yet, he\u2019s certainly coming off as one of the good guys in how he\u2019s defying blockbuster expectations by following his muse back into the classic rock era and casually claiming it as his own. He\u2019s still stuck on what\u2019s apparently his real first true love: analog.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHarry Styles\r\n\u201cFine Line\u201d\r\nColumbia Records\r\n\r\nProducers: Tyler Johnson, Kid Harpoon, Sammy Witte, Greg Kurstin, Jeff Bhasker.

Assaulting the keys, beating percussively on the pedals, smacking the sideboard and crooning away, he also provides a dazzling drum break without a drum. He and his band then top this with not one but a handful of cyclonic numbers. Connick in concert packs such dynamite that many other Broadway shows seem sedate.\nThe show runs for 13 perfs over two weeks at the Simon, which still seems to be in booking limbo while awaiting the promised-but-delayed arrival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Love Never Dies.\" If business is brisk, Connick and his musicians might easily slip back into town for a holiday week or two. A show this good can certainly count on a large chunk of repeat biz at premium prices.\nThis is Connick's third Main Stem appearance. He demonstrated a crowdpleasing presence in 1990 as a fresh-faced 23-year-old in \"An Evening With Harry Connick Jr.\" at the Lunt, and demonstrated full musical comedy talent when he buoyed the 2006 revival of  \"The Pajama Game.\"\n\"Harry Connick Jr. in Concert on Broadway\" starts out seeming like a standard touring gig, but Broadway is very much on the star's mind. Connick's self-effacing patter, breezily charming at first, turns personal; he discusses his lost Tony Award to the guy from that show across the street, \"Jersey Boys\" (\"Apparently, he was a lot better than I was\") and inserts several rueful mentions of \"Thou Shalt Not,\" the ill-fated Susan Stroman-helmed Broadway musical for which he provided the score in 2001. That said, he sees fit to raise the roof with one of that show's tunes, \"Take Her to the Mardi Gras.\"\nContributing to the magic of the second act is Lucien Barbarin, who quickly shows why Connick introduces him as one of the great New Orleans trombonists. The pair's take on \"St. James Infirmary Blues\" is astounding, with Connick pounding away and Barbarin sounding like a husky, mewling kitten that's swallowed a kazoo.\nThe two continue with four successive numbers, with Connick's main musicians  --  Jerry Weldon on sax, Neal Caine on bass, Arthur Latin on drums  --  pulled from the 20-piece band for solo after exceptional solo. Trumpeter Mark Braud comes down from the bandstand for the finale, and blows off what is left of the roof.\nConnick himself has provided the swinging orchestrations, and he salutes his soloists by name. The 10 strings are industriously employed in the first act, but by the end of the second sit jealously watching as the soloists and the rest of the brass section get to have all the fun.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 30.443964, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Connick, Jr. in Concert on Broadway ", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Connick, Jr. in Concert on Broadway", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "body": "After a reasonably expert first act, <em>Harry</em> Connick Jr. opens the second by trading in his Steinway for a battered honky-tonk piano and giving us a New Orleans-style &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; that is the most remarkable demonstration of musicality now on Broadway.

Tyro helmer Julia Murat brings a tactile sensibility and occasional striking visuals to her tale of a Brazilian village whose last 11 elderly inhabitants brush against the present when a young photographer suddenly appears. Though the focus is on one older woman (effectively played by Sonia Guedes) the film's spirit is embodied by the whole town, which lingers in the memory. A healthy fest life awaits.\nRoutine is about all that's left for Madalena (Guedes), a widow with a large house in a village forgotten by the world. Each day before dawn she makes bread, which she brings to the general store run by Antonio (Luiz Serra). They argue about how to place it in the near-empty shelves, have coffee together, and then she either returns home, where she may write a letter to her deceased husband, or she'll tend flowers at the cemetery gate, unable to get to the tomb itself because the gates are always locked.\nUnexpectedly, Rita (Lisa E. Favero) appears, a young photographer asking for a room for a few nights. Madalena reluctantly agrees, though she's unwilling to have her routine interrupted. Rita is the embodiment of the outsider, indifferent to the people she comes in contact with (in fact, she's rather rude) and only interested in the aesthetic elements she captures in her cameras.\nMurat, daughter of helmer Lucia Murat, is too nuanced a writer-director to make this into a simple clash of wills, or a feel-good story of intergenerational friendship. Though never explicit, the pic is suffused with a sense of waiting, as the elderly inhabitants go through their unchangeable routines in patient expectation of approaching oblivion.\nThe town is on the same trajectory. There is are train tracks, though they've long been disused; the inhabitants get together for a communal meal after mass, but the interaction is limited, as if all that needs to be said was done long ago. The sense of abandonment gives the place a melancholy air without pushing the idea of a depressive sadness.\nRita's character was likely a difficult one to develop in the concept stage: She can't be too open or too closed, nor too emotional, and the initial diffidence can be jarring. Her photos are palimpsests that fade in the foreground as if all is in danger of slipping away even as we're looking at them. An empowering portrait-sitting with Madalena is an understated spirit-lifter, though the unnecessary finale feels too much like the scripters were aiming for a bittersweet catharsis, and tries too hard to tie things up.\nIn the best scenes, lensing has an iconic power, recording the town and its inhabitants waiting for their end with a sense of regretful inevitability without any raging against \"the dying of the light.\" Lighting is effectively used naturally and sparingly, especially inside Madalena's home, where her stubborn presence seems to just hold the darkness at bay.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 30.29702, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> E.

It's just one of the nifty wrinkles in this unusually engaging spec.\rHalloween has always been a noteworthy time for fans of Harry Houdini, who died that night, after spending the latter part of his career debunking psychics who claimed they could contact the dead. (A fascinating tidbit involves Houdini's friendship with Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle, who believed a medium had communicated with his dead son.)\rFor anyone whose Houdini knowledge rests on the heavily Hollywoodized movie starring Tony Curtis, this is a particularly well-fleshed-out endeavor, showcasing a generous array of archival footage featuring the magician at work -- hanging upside down, say, as he wriggles out of a straitjacket.\rUnlike many of today's illusionists (some of whom, including host Lance Burton and David Copperfield, participate), Houdini's act hinged largely on his prodigious physical skills. This included the ability to hold his breath for several minutes, allowing him to execute his escapes from a water-filled milk can and a chamber he called the \"Chinese Water Torture\" trick.\rHoudini also possessed a \"masterful understanding of the interior of locks,\" a biographer notes, as well as a lock-pick collection that doubtless contributed to his title \"King of Handcuffs,\" though to this day no one knows precisely how he employed them. Burton adds a nice touch by extricating himself from a straitjacket near the end.\rEqually fascinating is how Houdini chafed at the numerous imitators who sprang up (including his brother, who operated under the name \"Hardeen\"), prompting him to invent ever-more-dangerous stunts that would be more difficult for others to duplicate.\rAlthough a Halloween-timed confection, docu also explores the significance Houdini held for early 20th century immigrants (a point alluded to in the book and musical \"Ragtime\"), offering symbolic escape from their drudgery as they toiled in backbreaking jobs. Blessed with an instinctive genius for marketing, his ascent from poverty to vaudeville's highest-paid performer burnished his credentials as a populist hero.\rIn that sense, \"Houdini\" represents the kind of History Channel fare that if sold properly could help bridge the gap to younger audiences -- a program that entertains without pandering or sacrificing its historical legitimacy.\rAnd if that pitch doesn't work, then just try, \"Teller speaks!\"", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 30.15704, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Houdini", "body": " a better understanding of the man, the various aficionados who weigh in include the usually mum half of Penn &amp; Teller, who is shot in silhouette so as not to see him speak.

Houdini's jealous younger brother, Theo, vibrantly played by Lewis Cleale, comes across much more vividly.\nGulan works valiantly, actually performing some of Houdini's magic and escape acts, but his Houdini makes surprisingly little impact: The musical never convinces that this man could have captured the world's imagination.\n\"Houdini\" begins and ends with a seance on the stage of New York's Palace Theater in 1936, 10 years after Houdini's death, but his spirit is brought forth neither by the seance nor the musical: The many disjointed scenes have no cumulative force. The score has its attractive aspects, composer-lyricist Duffield taking loving note of the popular music of the period, but the attractiveness isn't sufficiently theatrical.\nGrowing up in an impoverished home held together by their beloved mother (Barbara Andres), the man who became Houdini and his brother had a professional rivalry matched by a love for the same woman (Barbara Walsh). Even with the inherent family drama, the musical spends too much time on Houdini before he became a success.\nAs Houdini's wife, Walsh has a heartfelt singing voice and presence but seems too matronly against Gulan's boyishness.

Kathy Bates is just the person to deliver David E. Kelley's tart dialogue, and he surrounds her with enough quirky characters to make this Cincinnati-set spiritual companion to \"Boston Legal\" a breezy diversion. Whether that provides sufficient appeal for a show that rightfully belongs on CBS may be another matter.\nBates' Harriet \"Harry\" Korn is a big-time patent lawyer who experiences a near-death epiphany (two, actually) in the opening moments. Before you can say \"motion to dismiss,\" she's shifted gears from her mid-six-figure income to handling petty criminal cases, bringing her into conflict in the two episodes previewed with a snide prosecutor (\"ER's\" Paul McCrane), who has an odd habit of repeating himself, repeating himself.\nSometimes  --  indeed, a lot of the time  --  it feels like Kelley is doing this show just to get his political opinions off his chest, heavy-handedly so. As he did with \"Boston Legal,\" the cases and closing statements he crafts for his fictional counselors resonate with real-world implications, usually stinging conservatives, such as reminding the world that radio firebrand Rush Limbaugh is a \"drug addict.\"\nWhile that may be a turnoff to self-proclaimed dittoheads  --  especially those who see liberal media conspiracies everywhere they look  --  with Bates delivering the arguments and Kelley's knack for distilling issues to their essence, some people will find the mix just fine. Besides, what other show would borrow the theme from \"The Jeffersons\" to quickly establish the modesty of its environs?\nHarry's extended work family includes Nate Corddry  --  finally in a show whose sensibility suits him  --  as a promising young attorney who chucks his corporate gig to work with her; Brittany Snow as an assistant who moonlights selling shoes out of their ragtag office; and Johnny Ray Gill in a recurring role as a local thug with a Robin Hood streak, peddling protection to the locals while reminding them the police aren't apt to rush into their 'hood.\nAs for Bates, Kelley has given the \"Misery\" star a character worthy of her outsized personality  --  brandishing a pistol in her office, irritating judges and fearlessly speaking her mind. Moreover, the producers manage to take a jokey plot in the second hour  --  an old lady who commits armed robbery  --  and conjure rather poignant moments.\n\"Harry's Law\" has the kind of light procedural touch that CBS aimed for, but didn't deliver as well, on \"The Defenders.\" And while this show hardly establishes any precedent, it's pretty clear it doesn't intend to; Kelley simply had some things to get off his chest, and primetime is a better place than most to plead his case: His heroine may be an outsider, but at least Harry's no \"Outlaw.\"", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 30.037815, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry&#x27;s</em> Law", "sections": "<em>Harry\u2019s</em> Law", "body": "In television, marrying a writer to the right talent can often be more than half the battle, and so it is with &quot;<em>Harry</em>&#x27;s Law,&quot; the second NBC drama of the season about a disgruntled lawyer embarking on a late-in-life career change (OK, so &quot;Outlaw&quot; featured a Supreme Court justice  --  and lowered"}, "id": "562aa69807552319d5000021"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Harry Brown", "Joe Leydon", "Latest", "Read More About:", "U.K.", "Most Popular", "Amber Heard Says \u2018Aquaman 2\u2019 Role Got Cut Down: Action Scenes Were \u2018Taken Away\u2019", "Lance Bass Reenacts Amber Heard\u2019s Testimony, Joining Controversial Viral TikTok Trend", "Tom Cruise Says He Wouldn\u2019t Allow \u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2019 to Debut on Streaming", "Kevin Feige Wows Advertisers at Disney Upfront With Big Teases for Marvel\u2019s Disney+ Projects", "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Actor Ron Cephas Jones on Returning for William\u2019s \u2018Hauntingly Beautiful\u2019 Farewell", "New \u2018Bridgerton' Showrunner Explains Why Season 3 Is Skipping Straight to Penelope and Colin's Romance (EXCLUSIVE)", "Armie Hammer Special Among New True Crime Slate at ID and Discovery+", "Must Read", "David Cronenberg Breaks Down Cannes Walkouts, His New Film's Sexuality, and Why Netflix Turns Him Down", "Netflix Has Been Quietly Screening Movies, TV Shows Months in Advance for Subscriber Feedback (EXCLUSIVE)", "Asghar Farhadi Forcefully Denies Plagiarism Allegations: \u2018My Film Was Not Based on the Documentary\u2019", "\u2018Heartstopper\u2019 Breakout Yasmin Finney Joins \u2018Doctor Who\u2019 as Rose", "Forest Whitaker Reveals New Details on Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u2018Megalopolis,\u2019 Says Shoot Is Set for August", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "Interpol Conjure Up a \u2018Summer Jam\u2019 With New Song \u2018Fables\u2019", "Introducing \u2018Uncommon Scents\u2019: The 5 Best Men\u2019s Fragrances to Wear at the Office", "NBA Playoff Ratings Soar Thanks to Revived Warriors, Hungry\u00a0Celtics", "The 13 Most Comfortable Earbuds You Can Wear All Day, Every Day", "TVLine Items: The Hills Reboot, Netflix's New Iron Chefs and More", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "Harry Brown", "type": "Article", "tags": ["Tim Smith", "Toronto International Film Festival"], "post_id": 1200476193, "external_id": "44dd8bf8b77d866576e63bbb2b6a412cf2f45d7f", "content_type": "Article", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/rharrybrown.jpg?w=250", "url": "https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/harry-brown-1200476193/", "published_at": "2009-09-14T17:39:35Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-31T09:26:45Z", "topics": ["Markets & Festivals", "Reviews"], "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Joe Leydon", "popularity": 1, "body": "It's tempting, and not entirely inaccurate, to describe \"Harry Brown\" as a geriatric \"Death Wish,\" though many wags more likely will blurb it as Michael Caine's \"Gran Torino.\" Either way you look at it, this bleak, gripping, sporadically exciting drama about a retired soldier who takes aim at young hoodlums (and their not-so-young enablers) in his London public-housing complex could generate respectable theatrical coin and impressive homevid action. Pic should skew toward older auds, though many younger ticketbuyers may be curious to see ass-kicking by the actor they know best as Batman's butler. \nCaine is effortlessly and authoritatively credible in the title role, a stoic pensioner who's introduced during his death watch for his hospitalized wife. Resigned to spending his twilight years alone, he tries to ignore the drug-dealing and violent outbursts that are increasing common in his gone-to-seed apartment block. (Pic was filmed in and around the notorious Heygate Estate of London's East End -- ironically, not far from where Caine grew up.)\nBut when gang members brutally dispatch Harry's friend Leonard (David Bradley), after the old fellow unwisely brandishes a knife while traveling through their \"territory,\" Harry realizes he can't rely on help from a largely impotent police force represented by a well-meaning detective inspector (Emily Mortimer) and her cynical partner (Charlie Creed-Miles).\n\"Harry Brown\" is the work of first-time feature helmer Daniel Barber, a Brit filmmaker who cut his teeth on TV commercials and earned a 2008 Oscar nomination for \"The Tonto Woman,\" a dramatic short based on a Western story by Elmore Leonard. There's a discernible Western flavor to this drama as well, with Harry bearing more than a passing resemblance to the genre archetype of a long-domesticated fellow who must strap on his shootin' irons one more time to face down outlaws. After he begins his one-man crusade, his experience as a Royal Marine comes in very handy while he's gunning down armed miscreants or gaining necessary info through enhanced interrogation techniques.\nTo their credit, Barber and scripter Gary Young infuse the cliches with a fair degree of conviction. \"Harry Brown,\" like its eponymous hero, is a slow-burner -- Harry doesn't actually hurt anyone until a half-hour into the storyline -- and the filmmakers don't move too fast or push too far while building up to the action sequences. They're especially impressive while ratcheting up suspense during a deliberately paced sequence that shows how Harry manages to acquire firepower before disposing of drug-addled gun dealers.\nBarber doesn't shy away from depicting violence, but he doesn't dwell on it to a needlessly off-putting degree. He's also subtle about getting across plot points that help define characters: Without beating viewers over the head, he provides ample explanation for why Harry might interrupt his guerrilla war, and actually risk capture, to aid a young woman near death after a drug overdose.\nAlthough overlaid with a mood of despair that's only partly relieved by a relatively happy ending, \"Harry Brown\" remains, for all its touches of gritty realism, a revenge fantasy about someone aptly described by another character as \"a vigilante pensioner.\" Still, the supporting cast -- including many first-timers cast as young hoods -- is solid, and the moody lensing by Martin Ruhe (\"Control\") vividly conveys the no-hope squalor of a contemporary urban wasteland.\nMore important, Caine neatly balances ferocity and frailty, so that a viewer is never quite certain whether he's up to completing the bloody business at hand. Caine often has evinced an ability to turn on a dime from tearful anguish to fearful rage. But he's rarely had a role, or been in a movie, that required him to put that talent to such frequent use.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 29.99912, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Brown", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Brown", "body": "It&#x27;s tempting, and not entirely inaccurate, to describe &quot;<em>Harry</em> Brown&quot; as a geriatric &quot;Death Wish,&quot; though many wags more likely will blurb it as Michael Caine&#x27;s &quot;Gran Torino.&quot; Either way you look at it, this bleak, gripping, sporadically exciting drama about a retired soldier who takes aim at young"}, "id": "563e41f0827a6612100057fb"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Handsome Harry", "Ronnie Scheib", "Latest", "Most Popular", "Red Hot Chili Peppers Pay Tribute to Foo Fighters\u2019 Taylor Hawkins at Jazz Fest as Dave Grohl Looks on", "Judds Inducted Into Country Hall of Fame in Tearful Ceremony a Day After Naomi\u2019s Death", "Watch Carrie Underwood and Axl Rose Turn Stagecoach Into Paradise City With Two Guns N\u2019 Roses Songs", "\u2018That \u201970s Show\u2019 Spinoff \u2018That \u201990s Show\u2019 at Netflix to Reunite Most of Original Series\u2019 Main Cast", "Naomi Judd\u2019s Death Sparks Tributes From Carrie Underwood, Maren Morris and More: \u2018Country Music Lost a True Legend\u2019", "A24\u2019s \u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019 Hits Impressive Box Office Milestone", "\u2018No Time to Die\u2019 Producer Barbara Broccoli on Casting the Next James Bond: \u2018It\u2019s Going to Take Some Time\u2019", "Netflix Lost Subscribers, But It Really Lost Something Larger \u2014 Call It Mythology (Column)", "Judds to Be Inducted Into Country Hall of Fame Sunday, Wynonna Expected to Attend", "\u2018Outlander\u2019 Stars Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe, EP Maril Davis Discuss Season 6 Cliffhanger and Claire and Jamie's Fate", "Must Read", "Naomi Judd, Matriarch of the Judds, Dies at 76", "Bill Murray Gives First Comments on Inappropriate Behavior Complaint", "Pete Davidson Addresses Kanye West Harassment at Netflix Is a Joke Fest", "How the \u2018Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\u2019 VFX Team Made Nicolas Cage Young Again", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "John Oliver Calls Out the Dirtiest Kind of Racism", "Escape Plans: Inside Robb Report\u2019s May 2022 Travel Issue", "Sports Stocks Can\u2019t Hide From Bears as Index Hits 18-Month\u00a0Low", "How To Clean Outdoor Cushions Just in Time for Summer", "The Rookie: Grade Part 2 of the Spinoff Pilot, Tell Us If You'd Watch It", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "Handsome Harry", "type": "Article", "post_id": 1200474407, "external_id": "7e4eaafacf319a1f5c0f92d4786eff6c949d4c6c", "content_type": "Article", "image": "", "url": "https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/handsome-harry-1200474407/", "published_at": "2009-04-25T21:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-19T01:29:24Z", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Ronnie Scheib", "popularity": 1, "body": "\"Handsome Harry,\" the second of only two features Bette Gordon directed in the 26 years since \"Variety,\" finds the groundbreaking indie helmer recasting her feminism into an all-male study in gay denial. Scripted by '70s counterculture lenser Nicolas Proferes and thesped by a veritable who's-who of gifted character actors, the pic (like Gordon's 1998 \"Luminous Motion\") loosely resembles a road movie: A man, dragging along a secret, revisits co-participants in a traumatic event that transpired decades earlier. Beginning promisingly enough, \"Handsome\" soon turns monotonously angst-ridden, with all humor and personality falling by the wayside. Theatrical chances look iffy. \nAt the deathbed behest of Tom (Steve Buscemi), a buddy from his long-ago Navy days, Harry (Jamey Sheridan) sets off to convey Tom's profound apologies to a third ex-sailor, Kagan (Campbell Scott, as it turns out), whom they both have wronged. Since Harry himself is haunted by half-remembered snatches of a night only hazily glimpsed in flashback, he decides to call on his other guilty comrades to determine exactly what happened on that fateful evening.\nA dying Tom, fearful of going to hell, is a trip in itself, and launches Harry's quest in high style. The next stop on his personal stations of the cross maintains this promising flamboyance: Dropping in on boozing real-estate tycoon Peter (John Savage) during an ugly marital dustup, Harry soon finds himself kicked out, sharing a bed and a curiously tender night with Pete's wife, Judy (Mariann Mayberry).\nUnfortunately, subsequent meetings -- featuring Aidan Quinn in muddled antimilitaristic mode and Titus Welliver as the born-again husband of a paraplegic -- play more like baldly outlined sketches than fully fleshed-out scenes. Treating supplemental characters more as stepping stones on Harry's journey than as alternative answers to questions of what defines masculinity, Gordon puts all her emotional eggs in one basket -- the disclosure of Harry's terrible secret, which has become screamingly self-evident long before the dramatic denouement.\nYet even that might not have mattered had Gordon exploited the road movie's promise of surprising encounters and quirky revelations. Instead, as in \"Variety,\" the notion of all-consuming obsession takes over after a certain point, anticlimactically winding down by feeding exclusively on itself.\nIn \"Variety,\" Gordon's exploration of pornography and feminine voyeurism daringly implicated the very act of filmmaking, while bravely calling into question key feminist tropes. Here, however, her examination of male sexual identity, while benefiting greatly from astounding HD clarity and brilliantly sampled jazz, seems limited in terms of both narrative and mise-en-scene.\nA gaunt Scott, struggling to infuse his final showdown with Sheridan with enough unfulfilled promise to constitute tragedy, is constantly upstaged by compositions that trumpet their meaning so loudly, even Scott's silence seems redundant.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 29.98927, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "Handsome <em>Harry</em>", "sections": "Handsome <em>Harry</em>", "body": "&quot;Handsome <em>Harry</em>,&quot; the second of only two features Bette Gordon directed in the 26 years since &quot;Variety,&quot; finds the groundbreaking indie helmer recasting her feminism into an all-male study in gay denial.

Festival outings and some foreign arthouse sales look highly possible for this late October Swedish release.\rMarie (Endre) is married to Erik (Jorgen Langhelle), and her sister, Ninni (Ooms), to Jonas (Peter Gardiner). Both sisters are pregnant for the first time. During a dinner, Marie suspects there's something wrong with her child and both couples go to the hospital together. The doctors say Marie's child is fine but, when Jonas convinces Ninni to have the same check-up while they're there, Ninni's baby is found to have died.\rWhen Marie and Erik become parents, their relationship with Ninni becomes more strained. Ninni is their child's godmother, but her interest in the boy is increasingly obsessive: she tells strangers the baby is her own son, and even starts to breastfeed him.\rMarie becomes proprietary over the child, and argues with Erik.

Munch's usual stylishness and casual storytelling tenor lend persuasion to this curious drama about two brothers, both teen music idols, who demonstrate an incestuous attraction. That titillating theme just might earn \"Harry and Max\" slightly wider exposure than the writer-helmer's regrettably underseen \"Sleepy Time Gal,\" though \"Gal\" rang psychologically truer -- and required far less suspension of disbelief (or moral queasiness) -- than this current effort. \rThe two protags set out from their parents' tony Southern California home for a camping trip long promised by Harry (Bryce Johnson) to 16-year-old Max (Cole Williams), his younger brother by seven years. They're both playful and prickly with each other -- Max feels neglected, while Harry chafes at any criticism of his (admittedly problematic) lifestyle.\rHarry is in a popular \"boy band,\" with the band's fortunes hinged on a new album that might extend its winning streak or signal that its allotted 15 minutes are up. Max, meanwhile, has somewhat reluctantly commenced his own teen-dream chart career. When a female hiker begs his autograph (but not Harry's), alcoholic and temperamental Harry's insecurities are laid bare.\rBut the major tension between them isn't show-biz inspired; rather, it's sexual, with assertive Max eager to revisit an intimacy that apparently occurred during a Bermuda vacation two years earlier.\rCamping one night and in a motel the next, younger bro presses himself on skittish elder. Back in L.A., and obsessed with one another yet never quite on the same emotional page, the two young men spend an afternoon separately seducing each other's exes (Rain Phoenix as Harry's aggrieved former g.f. Nikki, Tom Gilroy as Max's erstwhile yoga teacher/lover Josiah) before one last, abortive nocturnal tryst.\rTwo codas chart first an awkward NYC reunion two years later, then a more tranquil coming-to-terms some time thereafter.\rWhile lead characters never do the deed during the story's timeframe (nor is there any real nudity), \"Harry and Sam\" definitely pushes the envelope in terms of lending potential fraternal incest an alluring frisson. Perhaps the strangest element here isn't the narrative conceit itself, but the fact that director Munch handles it in such typically low-key, benevolently observant fashion. Same cannot be said, however, for his at times soap opera-esque dialogue, which produces occasional howlers. Perfs do their best to imbue a somewhat dubious scenario with naturalistic conviction. The androgynous-looking Williams and, particularly, clean-cut Johnson (from late TV series \"Popular\") render myriad contradictory character behaviors at least somewhat credible. Michelle Phillips, who had her own moment in the pop spotlight with the Mamas the Papas long ago, appears for just one scene as the boys' well-intentioned yet profiteering mother.\rMicro-budgeted, minimally crewed pic nonetheless enjoys full benefit of Munch's fresh camera eye (lenser is his veteran collaborator Rob Sweeny) and knack for creating interesting visual/audio/editorial textures.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 29.896109, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> and Max", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> and Max", "body": " teen music idols, who demonstrate an incestuous attraction.

Predictable, gerrymandered, and -- on occasion -- so overwritten that it looks as if it might float off into the ether, first-time dramatist Valentine Guinness' play suggests a (not entirely) heterosexual version of Kevin Elyot's \"My Night With Reg\" sifted through a screenplay like \"Peter's Friends.\" That it retains our interest at all, and it does, is due to a terrifically charming and likable cast who keep you smiling with the characters even while laughing at the contrivances that engulf them.\nThe play takes place one brisk June night in a third-floor London flat belonging to Davy (Simon Dutton), a hack journalist who has invited over some long-standing chums to tend to the hapless title character, who is described as \"a disaster by anyone's standards.\" Harry takes his sweet time arriving, but in the meantime, an increasingly inebriated brigade gathers in a bachelor pad distinguished by a Doors poster and a noticeably stopped clock.\nPatrick (Adrian Lukis) has forsaken urban Britain for the pastoral idyll of life as a country sculptor, though he shares with the others an inability to escape his past. Before long, and fueled by booze, secrets come pouring out that lay bare everything from the fate of Davy's errant guitar to numerous sexual and social indiscretions that reveal at least two of the five fortysomethings to be far from the straight arrows that they might appear.\nPhil (James Wilby) is the play's Jimmy Porter, a noxious and homophobic truth-teller quick to violence and the worst of British public school drinking songs. He is revealed to have a more than passing appreciation of some of east London's kinkier boites. Antiques dealer Andy (Jay Villiers) admits that he can't see \"the sodding point\" of his meaningless life, while Michael (David Michaels) turns out to be the moneyed \"poof\" (Phil's mean-spirited description of him) whose status within the higher echelons of the law won't allow him to come out: \"Try being me for 20 years,\" he moans.\nGuinness, an heir to the brewery fortune as a well as lead singer in the rock band Darling, undoubtedly understands the way alcohol loosens lips, and the chain of revelations might seem less tiring if it weren't so programmatic. What the playwright cannot yet do is shift from badinage steeped in bile to swathes of poetry, many of them so faux-dreamily reminiscent that it is as if a room full of English achievers were all willing themselves to be Mary Tyrone.\nSuch passages mark the lone dead spots of Nickolas Grace's otherwise lively staging, which can't disguise elegiac tendencies that drag the energy level down. (By play's end, the men are mourning the cliches -- \"rolling wheat fields\" and the like -- that they never had.)\nLuckily, the actors all command attention, separately and together, even if one wonders what it was about this particular play that prompted as talented an actor as Wilby, the one-time star of \"Maurice,\" to make a rare return to the stage. Playing the acidic Phil, Wilby survives not one but two angry exit scenes, though one has to ask how anyone in his right mind would think this character capable of offering up even the slightest balm.\nEveryone else is far more sympathetic, from Lukis' Patrick, forever emending his remarks with endearing sheepishness, until he reaches a recollection lingered over with near-pornographic delight, to Villiers' suicidal Andy, who requests a wakeup call -- wait for it -- in time for Armageddon.\n\"Helping Harry\" has one other fundamental secret that won't go revealed here, but it's giving nothing away to relate that Armageddon never arrives. What does is an ace cast that lends total conviction to a deeply silly text.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 29.8634, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "Helping <em>Harry</em>", "sections": "Helping <em>Harry</em>", "body": "The year is young, but the 2001 theater year looks unlikely to offer up a loopier evening than &quot;Helping <em>Harry</em>,&quot; which could serve as a dramatic exemplar of what the English mean by tosh.

A tremendous, stellar cast is mostly confined to minor roles, but all shine under Allen's assured direction. With solid critical support, pic will fall in the middle of the box office range for this maverick writer-director --- not up there with \"Annie Hall,\" but not down with \"Shadows and Fog.\" Euro reactions should be positive for this ultra-sophisticated fare.\nThis study of a hopelessly immature writer, significantly named Harry Block and played by Allen, is likely to divide audiences, with the majority appreciating the filmmaker's bold, confrontational use of black comedy to expose the inner torments of his character. Others may not appreciate the brutal honesty, which is new to Allen's work; there are a significant number of scenes in which betrayed women verbally assault the hopelessly unfaithful Block.\nOne of the major achievements of the film is that, though it is structured in a highly complex manner, juggling back and forth between the actions of real-life characters and their fictional counterparts, it is always crystal clear what's going on. This clarity is particularly impressive in retrospect.\nHarry Block, though in late middle age, has never really grown up. He has a reputation as novelist and short-story writer, but he has already spent the advance supplied by his publisher for his next book, and is quite unable to find the inspiration to work on it. He's had three wives and six shrinks (one of whom he married), plus countless lovers along the way --- and he thinks he's abnormally sex-obsessed (he can't see an attractive woman without wondering what having sex with her would be like). He also openly advocates the use of prostitutes (this is another Allen film, along with \"Mighty Aphrodite,\" that prominently features a hooker).\nPicture's core, similar to that of \"Wild Strawberries\" by Allen hero Ingmar Bergman, deals with a journey the protagonist must make to a small upstate seat of learning, Adair College, to receive an award for his life's work. Though flattered, Block is also nervous and insecure about the trip, and determined to find someone to accompany him.\nTrouble is, his latest girlfriend, Fay (Elisabeth Shue), has chosen this moment to marry Larry (Billy Crystal), Block's best friend, so she's out of the running, though he desperately tries to make her dump Larry and return to him. Another friend, Richard (Bob Balaban), has heart problems and feels he might not be able to make the trip. And Block's plans to have his small son, Hilly (Eric Lloyd), see his father honored are thwarted because Hilly's psychiatrist mom, Joan (Kirstie Alley), refuses to let him go.\nMeanwhile, Lucy (Judy Davis), Block's former sister-in-law, is furious that Block, in his last book, described their clandestine relationship in thinly disguised detail; she turns up at his apartment wielding a gun with suicide, or murder, in mind.\nFrom the very beginning, Allen establishes an edgy, disjointed style to illustrate Block's fractured way of life. The opening credits are punctuated by repeated shots of a frantic Lucy arriving by taxi at Block's apartment. Daringly, the offending scene of intimacy between Block and Lucy is then reenacted, but as a \"fiction,\" taken from the book, with Block surrogate Ken (Richard Benjamin) dallying in the kitchen with his sister-in-law Leslie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) during a family barbecue only to be interrupted, in flagrante, by Leslie's blind grandma, who misinterprets the sounds she hears.\nThis raunchy, hilarious scene is a forerunner of more surprisingly explicit hijinx to come; this must be Allen's bawdiest film since \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex,\" with an unusually high four-letter word quotient for this writer-director, and some very blue jokes indeed. Some of the latter may make feminists blanch, but they serve to underline the immaturity of Block.\nThings get more complicated in another scene from one of Harry's books involving the Block character, now called Paul Epstein (Stanley Tucci), who marries his shrink, Helen (Demi Moore). All goes well at first, since Helen knows everything about Paul's personal and sexual quirks and makes allowances for them. But when she becomes a mother, she suddenly embraces extreme Judaism (\"You're like a born-again Christian, except you're a Jew,\" complains Paul). Helen proves to be a combination of Joan and Block's sister, Doris (Caroline Aaron), who turned to orthodoxy after marrying Burt (Eric Bogosian).\nGradually, Block's obsessions and demons are revealed, with a less and less flattering view of the character. He sees Larry as, literally, the Devil because he took Fay away from him, yet his treatment of Fay was never on the level. When apparently turned down by all his friends, he gets a colorfully garbed black hooker, Cookie (Hazelle Goodman), to come to the award ceremony with him. At the last moment, they're joined by Richard, who's changed his mind, and Hilly, whom Block \"kidnaps\" from school, sparking Joan's implacable fury.\nSprinkled through all of this are vignettes culled from Block's short stories, among them a hilarious episode called \"The Actor\" in which Robin Williams plays Mel, a movie actor who suddenly goes out of focus --- literally. Scene is skillfully conceived and filmed. Also very funny is an episode in which an old woman discovers her husband's \"dark secret.\"\nAllen successfully juggles all these characters and plot elements through the brisk 96-minute running time, revealing a character who, by his own admission, is \"spiritually bankrupt.\" Message of the pic is that each individual should accept his or her limitations and get on with living, or, as Richard puts it, \"to be alive is to be happy.\"\nBut Allen's Block is a tormented artist who finds it difficult to function in the real world, a man for whom bringing pleasure to people through his work is hardly enough. It's a revealing statement, if attributed to Allen himself. Film can be read as the director's answer to those who wonder how much of the real Woody Allen exists in the characters he plays in his films.\nWith an almost constant stream of mostly funny one-liners, Block is a typical Allen protagonist yet darker, sadder, more isolated, less mature. Allen is exploring the nature of an entertainer in much the same way that Bergman delved into man's relationship with God. In addition to the plot structure from \"Wild Strawberries,\" \"Harry\" contains a nod to another Bergman classic, \"The Seventh Seal.\"\nIn a film filled with great scenes, audiences should come away chuckling over the one in which Davis, excellent as ever, displays curiosity, embarrassment and fury --- while trying to keep a perfectly straight face --- and then drops to the floor in a faint. Among the higher-profile cast members, Williams isn't seen in focus at all, Crystal is surprisingly subdued as the caddish Larry, and Moore is dryly amusing as the shrink/wife.\nSome may question Allen's taste in making allusions to such taboo comedy subjects as the Holocaust. For the record, he also makes jokes about the Hollywood establishment, the media and sellers of aluminum siding, among others.\nPic is crisply shot by Carlo DiPalma, interestingly edited by Susan E. Morse (who visually depicts the jagged nature of Block's life via deliberately intrusive jump cuts) and handsomely designed by Santo Loquasto.

The dreamy opening evokes the canny, warm charm of a Christmas commercial, to the familiar tune of John Williams\u2019 iconic score (with an extra helping of jingle bells for good measure). The camera homes in on actors Emma Watson (who played Hermione Granger), Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) enjoying a crisp winter\u2019s day at their own quiet leisure before noticing envelopes bearing their names, telltale wax seals, and their precise locations where more typical addresses should be (i.e. \u201cEmma Watson, Secondhand Bookshop\u201d; \u201cMatthew Lewis, Black Cab Stuck in Traffic\u201d). As they open their invitations for the special, they play their parts with the same level of wide-eyed wonder that they brought to the first \u201cHarry Potter\u201d two decades ago.\r\n\r\nDepending on whether you're a longtime fan or a skeptical observer of the franchise, this wholehearted embrace of bottled magic may either thrill or bore you right off the bat. For anyone whose loyalties lie somewhere in between (as is the case for this viewer, a onetime \u201cHarry Potter\u201d obsessive whose devotion faded into adulthood), \u201cReturn to Hogwarts\u201d manages to unearth enough genuine sincerity, and occasionally even jolts of pathos, to keep from becoming quite as sticky sweet as one of Harry\u2019s treacle tarts.\r\n\r\nThe special traces the franchise\u2019s journey through all eight movies, making callbacks to particularly beloved movie moments and staging recreations of elaborate sets for the actors to marvel at together as they reminisce. Watson sits down with co-stars Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter himself) for familial talks about their inextricably linked childhood and stardom. Anyone who even vaguely followed the makings of these movies won\u2019t be too surprised by many of the \u201crevelations\u201d that come to light, such as the well-trod facts that \u201cPrisoner of Azkaban\u201d director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n made the main trio write essays about their characters, or that Watson and Grint felt so much like siblings by the films\u2019 end that their eventual kiss scene was, in Watson\u2019s words, \u201cthe most horrifying thing either of us had to go through.\u201d Even all this time later, they still know how to play their greatest hits.\r\n\r\nWith \u201cReturn to Hogwarts,\u201d HBO Max has officially cornered the streaming market on nostalgic reunions of beloved franchises past. First it revisited \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d for a surprisingly frank conversation about the show\u2019s legacy and controversies; then, the service made good on its launch promise to bring the entire cast of \u201cFriends\u201d together as a way of reminding everyone that \u201cFriends\u201d was gone from Netflix for good. Now that HBO Max has better established itself, it\u2019s easy to take the cynical (and inevitably correct) view that this extravagant look back at one of the most successful franchises in entertainment history is mostly just WarnerMedia flexing its content library muscle for all to see.  That it ends up charming as much as it does is a testament to its actors, game and charismatic as ever, once again finding a way to engross their audience in more intangible ways than merely following the script.\r\n\r\nBesides the core trio, supporting players like Lewis, Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Alfred Enoch (Dean Thomas), Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), and Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) chat about their parts in the overwhelming \u201cHarry Potter\u201d whole. Interviews with those who played the adults in the room underline just how many members of the distinguished class of British actors found a place in this wizarding world \u2014 and, in melancholy moments that go unspoken until later on, those indelible presences like Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore), Helen McCrory (Narcissa Malfoy), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) who have since died. I lost count of how many times someone insists the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d sets were \u201clike a family,\u201d and might\u2019ve cocked a more skeptical eyebrow if the deep understanding between Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint in particular wasn\u2019t so palpable.\r\n\r\nFor all those involved, one of the more intriguing aspects of the special is who isn\u2019t included \u2014 namely, \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling. While there are some fond mentions of \u201cJo,\u201d Rowling otherwise only appears onscreen in sparing excerpts from a 2019 interview. After spending the last couple years spreading baseless theories about trans people to the point that Radcliffe, Watson, and other cast members released statements affirming their support for the trans community, Rowling is quietly sidelined in this retrospective about how her work became an onscreen juggernaut. Her absence could\u2019ve been enormously awkward, so \u201cReturn to Hogwarts\u201d is smart to emphasize how these adaptations came together and impacted the world as blockbuster movies more than how Rowling\u2019s vision inspired it.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, then, \u201cReturn to Hogwarts\u201d focuses more on the physical filming process and emotional aftermath for its stars. There are further insights on the casting process, the brilliance of Stuart Craig\u2019s production design and, inadvertently through behind-the-scenes footage of each film, a handy visual representation of how the early movies\u2019 pride in practical effects morphed into reliance on green-screen CGI prove compelling on a pure level of \u201chow did this even all happen?\u201d level. When Radcliffe reunites with Chris Columbus, who cast and directed him as a child in the first two films 20 years ago, there\u2019s something undeniably poignant about seeing him now able to interact with Columbus as a true peer. The same holds true for getting to see Radcliffe reunite with the singular Helena Bonham Carter who, much to Radcliffe\u2019s utter delight, rips through the special like a mischievous tornado encouraging everyone else to follow her lead. (If this reunion were to have a host, she\u2019d be the only choice worth making.)\r\n\r\nSo, yes, \u201cReturn to Hogwarts\u201d is mostly aiming to envelop fans in a warm and fuzzy blanket of nostalgia. Nonetheless, there are a few revealing moments in which people admit just how overwhelming the entire phenomenon truly was: Grint choking up as he realizes how much his costars meant to him, Radcliffe explaining how growing up on this set became so \u201cfoundational\u201d to who they became after leaving it, Watson remembering how \u201clonely\u201d she felt after the weight of fame descended on her after \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d (as Felton, her childhood crush, emphasizes with protective fondness how \u201cgracefully\u201d she dealt with it). As calculated as this reunion is, these are surprisingly vulnerable admissions from people who have otherwise fiercely guarded their privacy for decades. Such bittersweet scenes, tucked in between the wistful smiles and footage of set hijinks, make for the special\u2019s most compelling material by a mile. They can never \u201creturn to Hogwarts\u201d as it once was, but they can still see and protect each other in a way that not one of the millions of people watching, despite this reunion\u2019s best efforts to explain, will ever truly understand.\r\n\r\n\"Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts\" premieres Jan. 1 on HBO Max.\u00a0", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 29.154, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "HBO Max&#x27;s &#x27;<em>Harry</em> Potter&#x27; Reunion Special Is Most Compelling at Its Most Bittersweet: TV Review", "sections": "HBO Max\u2019s \u2018<em>Harry</em> Potter\u2019 Reunion Special Is Most Compelling at Its Most Bittersweet: TV Review", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Potter", "body": "It should become clear within a minute of pressing play on HBO Max\u2019s \u201c<em>Harry</em> Potter\u201d 20th Anniversary special (\u201cReturn to Hogwarts\u201d) whether you\u2019re in or out for the nearly 2-hour special to come.

Essentially taking Alain Corneau's corporate thriller \"Love Crime\" and sticking it in blood-red platform heels, this tarted-up English-language remake affords some modestly campy pleasures, but lacks the delirious trash-horror verve of De Palma's best work. Even the juicy lead pairing of Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace, which promises solid international play, can't quite make this lurid but lukewarm divertissement seem worthy of its title.\nThe last film Corneau made before he died in 2010, \"Love Crime\" spun a diverting if preposterous tale of rivalry between a manipulative boss and her equally conniving underling  --  a ready-made vehicle for De Palma's pet themes of desire, duplicity, surveillance and murderous obsession. Indeed, until its over-the-top final scenes, \"Passion\" cleaves almost too faithfully to its source.\nApart from relocating the action to a Berlin advertising agency, De Palma's chief alteration is to lower the age of top exec Christine (played in the original by Kristin Scott Thomas and embodied here by McAdams), putting her and her ambitious colleague Isabelle (Rapace) on more equal footing while also extending the promise of hot girl-on-girl action. To further serve that marketable angle, Isabelle's male assistant is now a woman, Dani (Karoline Herfurth), and rest assured that every possible two-way lip-locking combination among these three attractive femmes will be exhausted by film's end.\nBeneath her ingratiating manner and killer smile, McAdams' Christine is one devious operator; that much is clear from a giggle-inducing sex scene in which a lover pleasures her while wearing a freakish white mask-and-wig combo apparently on loan from \"The Phantom of the Kabuki.\" Expertly manipulating Isabelle while showing her the ropes, Christine encourages the notion that they're not just colleagues but close friends, and not just close friends but maybe something more. But when Isabelle scores a major coup at work, New York native Christine, eyeing a possible transfer back to the firm's Gotham offices, immediately seizes credit for her protegee's performance.\nThis kicks off a round of retaliatory power plays, shocking humiliations and ultimately fatal consequences, complicated by the involvement of sleazy company boy-toy Dirk (Paul Anderson), whom neither Christine nor Isabelle is above using for sexual or professional gain. \"I'm just doing what you would do,\" Isabelle tells Christine, minutely observing the woman she would secretly like to become. \"Passion\" approaches its source with a similar degree of studied mimicry and personal embellishment, treating the twisty contours of Corneau's plotting as a pretext for a series of signature De Palma frissons.\nThe result is stuffed with enough outre sex, garish violence and modernist real-estate porn to entertain a general audience, but it nonetheless feels designed to appeal primarily to admirers of the writer-director's back catalog. From a basic narrative standpoint, there's no real reason for Christine to blurt out a ludicrous sob story about the identical twin she lost years ago (shades of \"Sisters\"), or for an extended split-screen sequence that ostentatiously divides the viewer's attention between a ballet performance and a carefully staged murder that resembles something out of \"Dressed to Kill.\"\nAs ever, De Palma remains under the spell of Hitchcock's \"Vertigo,\" from the Bernard Herrmann riffs in Pino Donaggio's score to a key suspense sequence that prominently features a bouquet of flowers and a winding staircase. Rather more germane is the film's simmering atmosphere of paranoia, generated by the characters' frequent use of Skype calls, cell-phone videos and old-fashioned security cameras.\nClearly, \"Passion\" means to be a hoot, a wet-dream thriller for cinephiles. But by the time it reaches its overwrought final act, the picture has generated neither the tension of its forebears nor the audacity that would allow it to transcend its silliness, a la De Palma's 2002 tour de force, \"Femme Fatale.\" Yet even in the absence of stellar material, the leads remain compulsively watchable: McAdams may lack Scott Thomas' hauteur, but more than makes up for it in cool, svelte malevolence, while Rapace provides an energetic counterweight, lending her more naive but also more unpredictable Isabelle an edge of dark desperation.\nAlthough Cornelia Ott's production design and Karen Muller-Serreau's costumes are easy enough on the eyes, the overall look of the Berlin-lensed picture isn't quite as sumptuous as one might expect; a slightly on-the-cheap feel persists that seems consistent with the indifferent nature of the material. D.p. Jose Luis Alcaine's palette darkens along with the story, bathing the firm's interiors in noirish shadows, an effective if self-conscious touch.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 28.956429, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Duplicity</em>", "body": " divertissement seem worthy of its title.\nThe last film Corneau made before he died in 2010, &quot;Love Crime&quot; spun a diverting if preposterous tale of rivalry between a manipulative boss and her equally conniving underling  --  a ready-made vehicle for De Palma&#x27;s pet themes of desire, <em>duplicity</em>"}, "id": "5b11303b0cc37f7229651f20"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Trouble", "Lisa Nesselson", "Latest", "France-Belgium", "Most Popular", "How [SPOILER] in the \u2018Doctor Strange 2\u2019 Post-Credits Scene Sets Up the MCU\u2019s Future", "Fred Savage Fired From Directing and Producing 'The Wonder Years' After Inappropriate Conduct Investigation", "Kim Cattrall Reunites the 'Sex and the City' Crew Absent From 'And Just Like That'", "Liam Neeson Joined \u2018Atlanta\u2019 to Poke Fun at His 2019 Racism Controversy and Say He\u2019s Sorry", "\u2018I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson\u2019 Renewed for Season 3 at Netflix (EXCLUSIVE)", "Bill Burr Says Johnny Depp Deserves Public Apologies If Amber Heard Loses Trial", "\u2018Leave It to Beaver\u2019 Star Tony Dow Announces His Cancer Has Returned: \u2018Truly Heartbreaking\u2019", "And Just Like That, Kim Cattrall Found Power in Saying No", "\u2018Percy Jackson\u2019 Disney+ Series Casts Aryan Simhadri as Grover, Leah Sava Jeffries as Annabeth (EXCLUSIVE)", "Patrick Stewart on Playing Charles Xavier Again in \u2018Doctor Strange 2\u2019: \u2018I Was a Little Unsure at First\u2019", "Must Read", "Kim Cattrall Delivers a Defiant Speech About Choosing Her Own Destiny", "Queen Latifah on Women Uniting: \u2018When We Stand Together There Is Nothing More Potent\u2019", "Amanda Seyfried Stands Up for Refugees and Abortion Rights at Power of Women: \u2018We Need to Be the Unstoppable Force\u2019", "Venus Williams on Equal Rights for Women: \u2018We Have to Work Harder to Earn More Respect\u2019", "Camila Cabello Hails Therapy, Calls for \u2018Reproductive Justice\u2019 in Powerful Speech", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "Fred Savage Fired from \u2018The Wonder Years\u2019 Over \u2018Multiple\u2019 Misconduct Claims", "Lewis Hamilton Wore 3 Watches, Including IWC\u2019s Latest, in Protest of Formula 1\u2019s Jewelry Ban", "Boehly Group to Buy Chelsea F.C. in $5.24 Billion\u00a0Deal", "What\u2019s New in Sex Toys?

Story of a happily married father whose wife is pregnant when he learns he has an identical twin brother, is classy genre fare anchored by a bang-up dual performance by Benoit Magimel. A guilty pleasure best enjoyed on the bigscreen, modestly budgeted pic looks terrific and warrants a look for fests and beyond. First-week biz in France has been only so-so.\nMatyas (Magimel), a commercial photographer specializing in school portraits, lives in a cocoon of domestic satisfaction with his wife, Claire (Natacha Regnier), and their young son, Pierre. Claire's belly is enormous, so the couple hasn't been having sex lately, but that's the only blip in their bliss.\nUntil, that is, Matyas gets a letter informing him that his mother has just died and there's an inheritance. As Matyas believed himself to be an orphan from the age of six, that's a shock. But not as strong as the jolt he gets at the reading of the will, where he meets his twin brother, Thomas (also Magimel).\nMatyas has no memory of a twin -- no memory of his childhood, in fact. Fissures appear in the facade of his middle-class contentment, and spread and deepen, as the suave, mysterious Thomas starts visiting Claire and Pierre. Thomas also encourages Matyas to visit his own wife, the shapely, hot-to-trot Elena (Hannah Novak).\nFourth feature by Belgian writer-director (and occasional thesp) Harry Cleven is thoughtfully executed at every level, with Matyas' growing unease abetted by a suitably unsettling score and nifty sound design. Cleven, who favors close-ups and extreme close-ups, also knows how to exploit the widescreen frame. Playing up Magimel's cleft chin and sensual profile, the camera treats the planes of the actor's face like a Tamara de Lempicka portrait made flesh. Shots in which the twins appear together are seamless.\nAlas, the script, written by five people, including Cleven, doesn't hold up quite as well to close scrutiny. But this is the kind of pic whose chief pleasures are in its creepy atmosphere and gradual accretion of clues, rather than the strict plausibility of its baroque twists.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 28.922123, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"body": ") <em>Harry</em> <em>Cleven</em> is thoughtfully executed at every level, with Matyas&#x27; growing unease abetted by a suitably unsettling score and nifty sound design. <em>Cleven</em>, who favors close-ups and extreme close-ups, also knows how to exploit the widescreen frame.

But they leave the theater humming \"Georgy Girl,\" the infectious film song that won the British star an Oscar nomination. In the interim, they are royally wooed, pursued, beguiled, enchanted and thoroughly captivated by this actor / singer/ dancer /acrobat / music-hall comic / voice artist / lyricist and raconteur -- a one-man band who lives only to make you laugh.\r\n\r\nWho wound this guy up? One unmistakable clue is the unit set for this solo party piece. Anna Louizos' nostalgic design presents a photographic view of an old-time English Music Hall, its faded glory caught and framed by the gaudy flashing lights of a cheesy proscenium arch. That evocative image imprints itself, becoming both theme and motif for this charming show.\r\n\r\nThe way Dale tells it -- in song, dance, poesy, patter, and clever combinations thereof -- he was only \"so high\" when his father took him to the local Music Hall, and that was enough to hook him for life.\u00a0 Never mind the songbirds, the female impersonators and the trampoline acrobats, this little boy was bowled over by the antics of the quick-witted comics. Determined to join their roguish ranks, he stole their jokes, memorized their routines and, at the age of seven, was already working on an act of his own.\r\n\r\nBy using the Music Hall as his touchstone, Dale manages to coordinate the many facets of his theatrical career into the semblance of a narrative.\u00a0 He got his first stage laugh, he remembers, at the age of eleven, when the little girl he was partnering failed to show up for a ballet competition and, in a burst of comic inspiration worthy of any top banana, he danced the pas de deux without her. \u00a0Re-creating that moment here, the thesp commands his long, loose limbs into balletic poses that show him to be surprisingly lithe and light on his feet, a hint of the hopeful young dancer he once was.\r\n\r\nThe Tony Award-winning helmer Richard Maltby Jr. understands revue structure, as he's amply demonstrated in shows like \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" and \"Song & Dance,\" and his directorial hand rests lightly on this material.\u00a0 Unobtrusive support also comes from Mark York, the cheerful onstage pianist who monitors the heartbeat of the show.\r\n\r\nFor all the breezy fun of it, this entertaining party piece is very well organized.\u00a0 An audience sing-along to the comic ditty \"Turned Up\" (which laments that everyone in the village turned up for Marry Ellen Bottomly's wedding -- \u00a0except the groom) is a fine introduction to Dale's early days on the Music Hall circuit.\u00a0 (At 17, he was the youngest comic on the boards.) An inspired novelty number with jaw-breaker lyrics -- \"You're Quoting Shakespeare\" -- is perfectly placed after an homage to Shakespeare's clowns (\"the original music hall comics\").\u00a0 \"There Is a Sucker Born Every Minute,\" the sparkling showpiece from \"Barnum,\" Dale's first Broadway musical, makes an especially well-timed appearance -- right after the fast-talking thesp (who won a Tony for playing \"the greatest humbugger the world has ever known\") has suckered the audience with \"one of the oldest Music Hall jokes I know.\"\r\n\r\nJust to show what a good sport he is, Dale makes up for that joke by telling one on himself.\u00a0 (It has to do with the taping of the Harry Potter oeuvre, and we won't spoil it for you.)\r\n\r\nImpressive though it happens to be, Dale's dramatic repertoire doesn't fit comfortably into his thesis that the past and future history of comedy can be found on the stage of the English Music Hall.\u00a0 This means that \"Scapino,\" which comes straight out of Commedia dell'Arte, makes the cut, but memorable productions like \"Comedians,\" \"The Road to Mecca,\" and \"The Threepenny Opera\" don't come up at all.\u00a0 To restore some balance, we do get a reading from Noel Coward's \"Fumed Oak,\" and the evening ends brilliantly with a scene from the great \"Joe Egg.\"\u00a0 (Big points for that one.)", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 27.844496, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Potter", "body": "The audiences at &quot;Just Jim Dale&quot; may be turning out to see the chap who gave voice to hundreds of characters as narrator of the entire series of <em>Harry</em> Potter audio books.

Perry's antiheroine, JR (Carlen Altman), a shallow, self-centered, mean-spirited, none-too-bright aspiring newscaster, has consistently alienated everyone around her, especially her immediate family. Nevertheless, she manages to browbeat sad-sack brother Colin (Perry) into accompanying her on a road trip through a negatively charged Americana. Hard to swallow but impossible to ignore, this nihilistic comedy may emerge as a cult touchstone.\nJR and Colin bicker during their drive to pick up JR's things from the journalism prof (Bob Byington) whom she had briefly shacked up with. The siblings' barbed insults take on the rhythm of a familiar refrain (Perry and Altman co-scripted), their long association having taught them the most hurtful buttons to push. If their shared disaffection sometimes bonds them against others (like the Christian fundamentalist motel owner who doubts they're brother and sister), they are just as liable to throw each other to the dogs. In either case, their caustic byplay is the closest either ever comes to a balanced exchange.\nIn every other interpersonal interaction, they come off as completely out of synch, unable (in the case of JR) or unwilling (in the case of Colin) to assume the expected social certitudes and platitudes that would gain them acceptance. At a party in their old hometown, JR's pathetic, self-deluded stabs at sophistication and Colin's self-fulfilling prophecies of failure practically invite humiliation, begging the question of which is worse, ignorance or cowardice.\nNeither JR nor Colin undergoes any pat learning experience  during their uncomfortably absurd travels. Salvation, or at least a modicum of authenticity, is achieved not through personal growth or change, but through mental disintegration. In an astonishing, rambling nine-minute monologue delivered in closeup (a more profound version of a similar scene in Perry's debut, \"Impolex\"), JR's ludicrous self-image slowly crumbles bit by bit, briefly revealing a vulnerability as touching as it is probably temporary. But this comes at a price, as family unity takes the form of a shocking transgression.\nSean Price Williams' grainy, monochrome 16mm camerawork imparts a bleak beauty to the unrelieved sameness of the siblings' odyssey and lends particular potency to the rug-pulling finale. Consistent with the mumblecore tradition of directors casting themselves and each other as actors in their movies, \"Wheel\" boasts helmers Byington (\"Harmony and Me\") and Ry Russo-Young (\"You Won't Miss Me\") in supporting roles, adding their particular brands of nastiness to the background characters' spiritual vapidity.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 27.717834, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Bosch"}, "id": "562bb86f8e9c0f7373000937"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "The Simpsons Movie", "Brian Lowry", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "James Cameron\u2019s \u2018Avatar 2\u2019 Debuts Visually Dazzling Footage at CinemaCon, Gets Official Title", "Psy and BTS\u2019 Suga Go West in New Single and Music Video for \u2018That That\u2019", "'Hunger Games' Returns With Prequel 'Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,' but Cast Remains Mystery", "Keanu Reeves Slays Enemies With Nunchucks in \u2018John Wick: Chapter 4\u2019 CinemaCon Footage", "Jason Sudeikis 'Had No Prior Knowledge' About Olivia Wilde Being Served on Stage at CinemaCon", "'Top Gun: Maverick' Blows CinemaCon Away: First Reactions Hail a 'Perfect Blockbuster'", "Openly Gay \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 Star Golda Rosheuvel Was Told by a Lesbian Director to Stay in the Closet", "ACLU Says Amber Heard\u2019s Domestic Violence Op-Ed Aimed to Capitalize on \u2018Aquaman\u2019 Press", "Elisabeth Moss Speaks Out on Scientology, From \u2018Handmaid's Tale\u2019 Criticism to Profane Emmys Speech", "Harry Styles and Florence Pugh Get Hot and Heavy in Olivia Wilde's 'Don't Worry Darling' Sneak Peek", "Must Read", "\u2018Spider-Man\u2019 at 20: How Sam Raimi and Sony Pictures Rescued the Superhero Genre and Changed Hollywood Forever", "Justin Lin\u2019s \u2018Fast X\u2019 Exit Puts Universal in a Tricky, and Costly, Race to Replace Him", "Alan Cumming Offering $10,000 Reward for Any Info on Missing Chimpanzee Co-Star (EXCLUSIVE)", "\u2018Mr. Saturday Night\u2019 Review: Billy Crystal Brings the Laughs in His New Broadway Musical", "\u2018Avatar 2\u2019 Star Sam Worthington Talks \u2018Mind-Blowing and Marvelous\u2019 Sequel", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "Is Drake Horny for Abby Shapiro?", "From Estate Jewelry to Innovative Art, the Philadelphia Show Puts a Treasure Trove of Collectibles on Display", "Todd Boehly Nears Deal to Acquire\u00a0Chelsea", "This Kasa Power Strip Combines 6 Smart Plugs Into 1 Device, and It\u2019s 41% Off Right Now", "Moon Knight Makes Debut on Nielsen's New Top 10, Bridgerton Still Dominates", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "The Simpsons Movie", "type": "Article", "tags": ["Ellen Lovejoy", "Harry Shearer Documentary"], "post_id": 1200557648, "external_id": "f4753a300a211aacef333c70bbe52823706eda86", "content_type": "Article", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/rsimpsonsmovie.jpg?w=250", "url": "https://variety.com/2007/film/awards/the-simpsons-movie-1200557648/", "published_at": "2007-07-24T15:28:52Z", "updated_at": "2018-06-20T18:15:42Z", "topics": ["Awards", "Markets & Festivals", "Reviews"], "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Brian Lowry", "popularity": 1, "body": "After 18 years and 400 episodes, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has developed a wide array of potential moviegoers, from those who still watch to those who once watched to those who don\u2019t watch anymore but now have kids that do. The question is how many will feel inspired to ante up for something so readily available for the price of enduring commercials and Fox\u2019s incessant on-air promotion. Happily, the long-gestating movie itself offers a fine incentive, and Fox\u2019s inspired marketing campaign (7-Eleven becoming Kwik-E-Mart? Genius) should ensure enough curiosity to stuff the studio\u2019s pockets, as it were, with dollars from doughnuts.\rPut simply, if somebody had to make a \u201cSimpsons\u201d movie, this is pretty much what it should be -- clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted with a larger-than-22-minutes plot, capable (just barely) of sustaining a narrative roughly four times the length of a standard episode.\rOn its face, this is no small accomplishment. The conundrum of expanding a TV program (particularly of the animated variety) to feature size and scope has always posed a tricky proposition -- one conquered by the coarse laughs of \u201cBeavis and Butt-head Do America\u201d and \u201cSouth Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,\u201d but resulting in disappointment with, well, just about everything else.\rNeither of those other properties, however, possesses the mass appeal of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d and the credited team of 11 writers (all of them at one time producers on the show) have incorporated plenty of knowing flourishes the audience will surely appreciate -- among them an especially smart bit at the outset, directly addressing why anyone would pay \u201cto see something we get on TV for free.\u201d Along the way, the writers gleefully bite the hands that feed them at Fox, dismiss Disney as an evil empire, and lampoon U.S. government functionaries as inept buffoons who celebrate finally catching somebody they\u2019re pursuing.\rSeizing on an environmental theme, the plot hinges on rampant pollution of the local lake, with the thoughtlessness of family patriarch Homer (Dan Castellaneta, who provides no fewer than 10 different voices) yielding an epic screw-up, imperiling the entire town of Springfield.\rUnder ruthless bureaucrat Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks, credited as A. Brooks), the Environmental Protection Agency declares the commu-nity a quarantined disaster area, prompting the local citizenry to literally march on the Simpson residence with torches and force the whole brood into retreat. It thus falls to Homer to find a way to save the town, in the process redeeming himself in the eyes of his wife Marge (Julie Kavner) and son Bart (Nancy Cartwright), who has grown to feel so neglected by dad that he takes refuge with Bible-thumping neighbor Ned Flanders (Harry Shearer).\rThere are multiple side plots as well to help flesh out the story, from Grandpa making an ominous prophecy to Homer adopting a pig to daughter Lisa (Yeardley Smith) being smitten with a guitar-playing Irish youth who shares her passion for environmentalism.\rFor all of that, the movie drags in places. Yet as is invariably the case with \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d the smaller, practically throwaway gags often provide the biggest laughs, whether it\u2019s Tom Hanks\u2019 earnest cameo as himself, a \u201cTitanic\u201d riff or Bart\u2019s sure-to-be-talked-about skateboarding sequence, yielding a fleeting but riotous glimpse of animated genitalia. (Despite a PG-13 rating, the humor seldom feels more scabrous than an average episode.)\rTechnically, the movie capitalizes on its enhanced aspect ratio without altering the show\u2019s fundamental look, though there are moments of computer-generated scale that clearly embrace the feature canvas, employing more than the typical TV toolkit.\r\u201cThe Simpsons Movie\u201d clearly represented a marketing challenge, and, given the build-up, Fox appears to have been equal to that task. As for magnifying the series without losing its deeply ingrained charms, the producers have mostly passed that test as well, proving their 18-year-old child was ready to go out and face the big bad (theatrical) world.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 27.622314, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"sections": "<em>Harry</em> Styles and Florence Pugh Get Hot and Heavy in Olivia Wilde&#x27;s &#x27;Don&#x27;t Worry Darling&#x27; Sneak Peek", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Shearer Documentary", "body": " refuge with Bible-thumping neighbor Ned Flanders (<em>Harry</em> Shearer).\rThere are multiple side plots as well to help flesh out the story, from Grandpa making an ominous prophecy to Homer adopting a pig to daughter Lisa (Yeardley Smith) being smitten with a guitar-playing Irish youth who shares her"}, "id": "562a9c31e621f4322c00027c"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Battle Royale", "Robert Koehler", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Japan", "Most Popular", "Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney Expected to Exit \u2018SNL\u2019", "Vomit, Poop and Woody Harrelson: \u2018Triangle of Sadness\u2019 Shocks Cannes With Uproarious Eight-Minute Standing Ovation", "Halsey Claims Label \u2018Won\u2019t Let Me\u2019 Release New Song \u2018Unless They Can Fake a Viral Moment on TikTok\u2019", "How 'SNL' Said Goodbye to Kate McKinnon, Pete Davidson, Aidy Bryant, and Kyle Mooney", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him (EXCLUSIVE)", "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 4 Is the Show at Its Biggest, Broadest and Most Emblematic of Netflix\u2019s Evolution: TV Review", "Mick Jagger on Harry Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "John Mulaney Draws Criticism for Having Dave Chappelle Open, Tell \u2018Transphobic Jokes\u2019 at Ohio Show", "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u2019 Trailer Teases Tom Cruise\u2019s Biggest Stunts Ever", "Johnny Depp\u2019s Agent Says His Star Power \u2018Dimmed\u2019 Due to On-Set Behavior", "Must Read", "Kendrick Lamar's 'Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers' Bows at No. 1 With Year\u2019s Biggest First-Week Debut", "\u2018Holy Spider\u2019 Review: A Taut, True-Crime Procedural Tangled in the Wicked Web of Iranian Patriarchy", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him", "Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve on Lea Seydoux Starrer 'One Fine Morning;' Clip Unveiled", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "Jared Kushner\u2019s Middle East Peace Plan Involves Nations Giving Him Billions of Dollars", "Alpha\u2019s New 116-Foot Superyacht Has 3 Decks Primed for Outdoor Entertaining", "MLS Marketing Arm Extends Deal With Mexican National\u00a0Team", "The Best Mattress Bags Protect Your Pieces in Storage and During Moves", "Endeavour to End With Season 9", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "Battle Royale", "type": "Article", "tags": ["Harry Lewis", "Lord Of The Flies", "The Royale"], "post_id": 1200466268, "external_id": "6589809f9f58df34ade3ee9081a129f2fb57e99c", "content_type": "Article", "image": "", "url": "https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/battle-royale-2-1200466268/", "published_at": "2001-01-22T23:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2018-06-10T11:32:49Z", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Robert Koehler", "popularity": 1, "body": "Departing from two decades' worth of domestic and personal dramas and returning to his roots as Japan's maestro of mayhem, Kinji Fukasaku has delivered a brutal punch to the collective solar plexus with one of his most outrageous and timely films, \"Battle Royale.\" Pic is based on first-time novelist Koshun Takami's phenomenally successful dystopian fiction (made even more popular when adapted to a manga) about a sinister game that forces kids in junior high to kill or be killed over the course of three days on a deserted island. The object of unprecedented controversy in Nippon, the film has racked up huge B.O. since its mid-December opening, preceding its international premiere in L.A. at the American Cinematheque's tribute to the helmer and a slot in the Rotterdam fest.\nFukasaku and his screenwriter son Kenta have reframed the story as a horrific battle imposed by adults on children, a kind of high-tech, fascistic variation on William Golding's \"The Lord of the Flies.\" In doing so, however, the deeper motivations of many of the principals -- as well as the specific social realities in a decaying Japan around the year 2002 -- are glossed over in the interest of a visually splendid, ultra-violent body-count spectacle that sometimes lapses into the crudely sentimental. Recalling some of the outrage over youth violence \"A Clockwork Orange\" generated in early-'70s Britain, \"Battle Royale\" was slapped with an R-15 rating (no one under 15 admitted) by the Japanese rating board, which rarely applies the restriction to violent films. That action was just one element in a concerted political campaign against the film, partly motivated by the concern that teens would wage copycat crimes, in light of a reported increase in murders by the nation's traditionally peaceful teens.\nLike U.S. congressional efforts to stem violent content in mass-media entertainment, counterparts in the Diet (Japan's parliament) have led the charge for control over violent pics, videos and the rest, citing \"Battle Royale\" as a dramatic symbol for their cause, with some publicly labeling Fukasaku's film as \"rubbish.\"\nThe irony is that the curious teen crowds who have lined up overnight to see pic are likely unaware of the prolific 70-year-old director's work and have probably not seen any of his 60 films. Outside the Japanese social framework, \"Battle Royale\" is best viewed in terms of the vet director's crafty employment of his skills as a maker of extraordinary war and yakuza pics. Here he creates a nightmare vision of the near-future in which war is played out as a deadly game by those too young to understand the deeper meanings of life and death. Depth, though, is clearly not Fukasaku's aim; his film impatiently offers only a wisp of exposition before getting to the bloody stuff.\nIt seems that Japan's economy in the early 2000s has taken a major dive, with double-digit unemployment and kids rampantly boycotting school and attacking adults. The school system, in concert with the military, has devised a fearsome law-enforcement device called the Millennial Reform School Act, aka the BR Act, in which a junior high class is selected by lottery and sent to an island where it will play Battle Royale. Class B in Zentsuji Middle School, thinking it's going on a holiday, is gassed on its bus and sent to the island -- where the 44 students are confronted with angry teacher Kitano (Beat Takeshi), who teaches them the game's rules in one of the most startling scenes of mayhem since the movies of the wild and bloody '70s.\nA problem from the start is that the precipitating act for Kitano -- a sudden attack on him two years prior by a pupil, sending him on hard-hearted revenge against his class -- is presented in a choppy, frenzied manner, and his new role as ruthless Battle Royale game-keeper feels like an absurd overreaction. Takeshi's trademark style as a comically calm presence capable of explosive acts perfectly fits the role, and he is, if anything, an even more fearsome force of violence than the tough-guy personae he's played in the films he writes and directs.\nThe kids, terrified out of their minds by Kitano and the reality that only one of them will be left alive after three days (a lethal necklace will detonate at game's end if more than one lives), are given backpacks with survival goods and a weapon and let loose on the island. It's quickly clear that the film's body count will mount to outrageous numbers, and by slow increment (each death itemized by a mordant use of onscreen graphics), and just as clear that our sentiments are to go for Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara), who recently witnessed his jobless dad hang himself, and naive Noriko (Aki Maeda). His weapon is a trash-can lid, hers is a flashlight, and they appear hopelessly mismatched by such instant teen killers as Mitsuko (Kou Shibasaki), who's a whiz with a sickle, and two punk transfer students, Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) and Kiriyama (Masanobu Ando).\nBodies fall -- in the gruesome style Fukasaku perfected three decades ago -- until a mere dozen teens remain. The helmer haplessly tries to set up a contrast between Kiriyama's killing-machine nihilism (he's not a real student, but hired to kill as many as possible) and the hearts-and-flowers of Shuya and Noriko, who are befriended by Mitsuko, a survivor of a previous Battle Royale. But Fukasaku is far more himself with such scenes as the one in which a band of girlfriends are chatty one minute, mowing one another down in paranoid fear the next. The notion that girlish cliques can go John Woo on each other ends up being one of the movie's funniest, darkest jokes. The conclusion suggests some of the ironic twists of Takeshi Kitano's films, even if it is pointless and illogical.\nGiven the most basic characters to work with, the mostly teen cast attacks the material with frightening gusto, and Fujiwara dutifully invokes the voice of inner moral conflict. Production is exceedingly handsome and vigorous, offering no sign that Fukasaku is slowing down.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 27.541368, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"sections": "Mick Jagger on <em>Harry</em> Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Lewis"}, "id": "562b1d15c75d071eee0001c3"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Album Review: \u2018Harry Styles\u2019", "Jem Aswad", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "\u2018SNL\u2019: Steve Martin Makes Fart Jokes With Selena Gomez", "Las Vegas\u2019 Lovers & Friends Festival Takes Chaotic Turn With Reports of Trampling Due to \u2018Security Incident\u2019", "Gunman Kills 10 People in Buffalo, N.Y.

While the album doesn't sound out of time, there's really not much to place it in 2017: It's loaded with acoustic guitars and has nary a trap beat, drop or apparently even an electronic drum. It even feels like an old-school vinyl album: In an era when many long-players have 18 songs and hover around the 70-minute mark, this one's got an even 10 tracks and clocks in at 40 minutes, without feeling skimpy. It's even, at least subconsciously, divided into sides: the softer side one and the rockier side two, which kicks off with the hard-riffing \"Only Angel\" (hell, the song's even got a cowbell) and roars into the even ballsier \"Kiwi\" before downshifting for the final three tracks.\r\n\r\nBut despite the guitars and the hype about how \"rock\" \"Harry Styles\" is, it's miles away from the Rolling Stones or even the sweeping rock anthems purveyed by two of this album's patron saints, David Bowie and Queen. Instead, their influence is heard more in the cinematic sweep of the ballads, along with dashes of Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Nilsson (the arrangement on this album's lead single, \"Sign of the Times,\" is more than a little reminiscent of his 1973 hit \"Without You\"; \"Carolina\" has some of his quirky charm) and even Badfinger \u2014 the guitar line in \"Ever Since New York,\" which is lifted almost directly from that group's 1972 power-pop chestnut \"Baby Blue,\" surely is no accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary sonic architects here are executive producer Jeff Bhasker (Fun, Kanye West, Beyonce, Mark Ronson's \"Uptown Funk\") and two of his longtime associates, who bring even more diversity: co-producer/guitarist Alex Salibian worked with Young the Giant, country singer Cam and big-voiced pop thrush Elle King; co-producer Tyler Johnson's studio pedigree includes OneRepublic and Ed Sheeran, and he wrote songs with or for Cam, Keith Urban, Miley Cyrus and John Legend. Yet that's not to downplay the decisive mark Styles makes here: He co-wrote every song, played guitar and performed all of the vocals on several (check out his impressive stacked harmonies on \"From the Dining Table\"), and makes his mark as a strong and distinctive lead singer.\r\n\r\nAnd there's no question whose album this is: You never think for a second that he's not doing exactly what he wants, as far as it may place him from the teen-pop realm that made him a superstar. And while there are definitely hits on the album \u2014 \"Sign of the Times\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 there's nothing you'd exactly call a \"banger.\" In fact, the most likely second single from the album, the acoustic lilt \"Two Ghosts,\" is closer to contemporary country than pop radio (and not just because it's supposedly about his ex, Taylor Swift).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the big question here is where this leaves Styles' millions of young fans. The rapturous critical response and receptive ears in later generations thus far speak to the album's quality and generation-spanning appeal (and it's safe to say that Eagles manager Irving Azoff, father and partner of Styles' manager Jeffrey Azoff, knows how to market to an older audience). But will the kids come along? Will \"Harry Styles\" be the summer soundtrack for bonding moments between rebellious teens and their parents, or will the kids feel he's abandoned them? Indeed, he sings \"I've never felt less cool\" on the closer, \"From the Dining Table.\"\r\n\r\nTime will tell. But either way, Styles has made a bold and brave statement of intent that completely reinvents him as an artist \u2014 and leaves a wide-open road for whatever he might want to do next.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 27.122566, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "Album Review: &#x27;<em>Harry</em> Styles&#x27;", "sections": "Album Review: \u2018<em>Harry</em> Styles\u2019", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Styles", "body": "<em>Harry</em> Styles\r\n&quot;<em>Harry</em> Styles&quot;\r\n(Erskine&#x2F;Columbia)\r\n\r\n\r\nEven with all the pre-release chatter about the rock leanings and &#x27;70s vibe of <em>Harry</em> Styles&#x27; debut solo effort, few people probably predicted the 23-year-old ex-One Direction superstar to drop\u00a0the kind of album that makes your uncle or your mom"}, "id": "5916ab9e0711e84cdb421c7b"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Harry Loves Lisa", "Brian Lowry", "Latest", "Read More About:", "TV Land, Wed.

Free publicity aside, hopefully someone will hide the paper before he sees this review of his unscripted half-hour comedy/drama with wife Lisa Rinna, which exhibits a deflating kind of desperation. The couple has already made separate appearances on \"Dancing With the Stars,\" and now transforms their lives into a kooky TV Land sitcom-like construct, only with mixed-in moments of bathos. After one heavily staged episode, it's hard to imagine anyone being particularly wild about \"Harry.\"\rAs with many a reality show, this one labors to create its own familiar narrative framework  --  the self-described hook, if you believe the central duo, being Hamlin is cerebral and cautious while Rinna is a wacky free spirit. TV Land calls them a \"celebrity uber-couple,\" which suggests someone should be forced to take remedial German.\r\"I can't keep my mouth shut,\" she says cheerily about causing a stir with her Twitter account, having tamely bad-mouthed another reality star for excessive plastic surgery, inviting charges of hypocrisy because of those puffed-up lips.\rHamlin, meanwhile, goes on an audition that badly misfires (viewers aren't privy to the offending performance), not very convincingly prompting him to try his hand at stand-up comedy. In doing this he seeks strategic counsel from actor-comic Robert Wuhl, which  --  along with the \"This season on\" tease  --  suggests there will be no shortage of celebrity guests.\rLike a lot of programs built around private lives of the famous and once-famous, the producers work too hard trying to engineer such conflicts.

Pottermania will reach a peak in July with the nearly simultaneous release of the fifth film and the seventh and final book, and only commercial concern for Warner Bros. may be that, after the second or third week, curiosity about the concluding tome could overshadow interest in the film. \rExtravagantly produced in the expected manner, pic nevertheless marks a notable departure in tone from those that preceded it. From the opening scene, portents of bad tidings ahead hang over everyone and everything connected to the wizarding world, even as the magical establishment insists there is no threat at large in the land.\rAltered feel this time around stems in large measure from the new blood recruited to push the franchise into ever-darker domains. Director David Yates, heretofore known mostly for his television work (and already engaged to helm the sixth film); screenwriter Michael Goldenberg, replacing series perennial Steve Kloves; and composer Nicholas Hooper, whose vigorously dramatic music uses only a smidgen of John Williams' themes, make the most decisive difference in steering the focus away from flights of fancy and in-house intrigue in favor of elaborate and sometimes heavy-handed foreshadowing of the inevitable showdown between Harry and Lord Voldemort.\rConcentrated focus results in an unsettling mood and dramatic scenes of unusual intensity. But condensing the book, which at 870 pages is the longest J.K. Rowling has written, into the shortest film in the series has come at a price. Many viewers won't at all mind that this is the first \"Potter\" picture without a Quidditch match, nor that house elves and cutesy ghosts are largely absent as well.\rBut more serious is the diminishment of the myriad intrigues among individuals and factions that comprise so much of the stories' delightfully complicated fabric. Interplay detailing the fluctuating relationships involving Harry, Hermione, Ron (particularly slighted here), Cho Chang and intriguing newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is sacrificed in favor of repeated group scenes of Harry teaching his clandestine band of teenage warriors the finer points of wand work. Classroom scenes are scanted and a sense of the school year passing is minute, giving the film a flattened-out feel compared to the wondrous eventfulness of Mike Newell's \"Goblet of Fire,\" the last and most successful series installment.\rCurrent yarn commences at the end of a parched English summer, when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, back with a clean-cut look) lands in hot water with the Ministry of Magic for issuing a forbidden curse to fend off an attack by two Dementors. Harry's Inquisition-like hearing, where he narrowly escapes expulsion from Hogwarts thanks to the unexpected intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), sets out the central conflict: The Ministry refuses to accept Harry's contention that Lord Voldemort is back and, in fact, is prepared to put all its propaganda muscle into discrediting Harry and Dumbledore.\rTo this end, the Ministry imposes one of its own as this year's professor of the Dark Arts. Dolores Umbridge is one of Rowling's most delicious -- and resonantly named -- creations; a stout, toad-like woman reliably clad in shades of pink, Umbridge is a party functionary par excellence, a rules-and-regulations fanatic with a whim of iron who cloaks her proscriptive edicts in dulcet tones and manufactured smiles. Imelda Staunton was the perfect choice for the part and unsurprisingly emerges as one of the film's greatest pleasures.\rUmbridge wastes no time clamping down on Harry, the other kids and the Hogwarts staff; assuming more power virtually by the day, she puts her most outspoken student in painful detention, prohibits the learning of practical curses, begins firing wayward teachers and ultimately confronts Dumbledore to assert complete Ministry control over the school.\rIn response, Harry assembles an underground rebel band known as Dumbledore's Army. The intense way these passages are staged lead one to believe they are the scenes that most engaged the interest of director Yates, who seems to relish the image of Harry and Hermione as nascent revolutionary leaders.\rSimilarly prominent are Harry's renewed relationship with his beloved godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), hiding away in the secret family homestead in London, and his nightmarish visions of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), with whom he increasingly feels a disturbingly strong connection. It gets so bad that he is forced to receive private tutoring from the dreaded Professor Snape, whose distaste for the task could not be more pronounced. Until shortly before the end, Snape has very little to do, but Alan Rickman may have outdone himself; seldom has an actor done more with less than he does here.\rClimactic showdown between Harry's crew and Voldemort's henchmen, led by Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), is strikingly played out in a huge Ministry storeroom filled with shelved grapefruit-sized globes containing prophecies. One such sphere concerning Harry is of vital interest to Voldemort, and performing especially well on his behalf is Sirius' malignant cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, embodied by Helena Bonham Carter with a particularly maniacal glee.\rIt doesn't take much of a leap to connect the ill winds afflicting Hogwarts, along with the sweaty anticipation of inevitable conflict, with the present situation in the world at large. The metaphors are all implicit and have a lot to do with just growing up and facing unpleasant realities, but they increasingly contribute to the feeling of nervousness and unease creeping into the series.

The previous Harry Potter games dutifully guided the player through the events of the latest movie, plot point by plot point, playing out as a typically tepid action/adventure slog. But, appropriately for a story in which the young wizard is entering adolescence, \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d is a more sophisticated creation that brings the open world experience of \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d to a family-friendly title.\rAfter a brief introduction and an obligatory wand-work tutorial, the player is deposited in the lobby of Hogwart\u2019s School. Most of the game consists of doing quests to persuade students to join Dumbledore\u2019s Army, a secret cadre dedicated to protecting Hogwart\u2019s from the imminent return of the evil Voldemort. Quests can be tackled in any order, and range from magical battles to uncovering secrets to simple fetch missions. Along the way, \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d offers all sorts of optional missions, side activities, and minigames, including full-blown bouts of chess, a tile-matching game, and the Harry Potter equivalent of marbles. \rHogwarts and environs are cleverly presented so that the player never has to sit through a loading screen, which helps create the sense of exploring a sprawling magical castle. This is a good old-fashioned funhouse, full of hidden doors and crumbling bric-a-brac that Harry can set right with his wand, unlocking bonus con-tent. The locations are so opulently drawn that the real star here is the setting, which is livelier than the creepy mannequin-like presentations of actors Daniel Rad-cliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron). \rFor dyed-in-the-wool fans of J.K. Rowling\u2019s series, \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d is brimming with lore and references to the earlier books. The story charges merrily ahead without bothering to explain muggles, snitches, or dementors, much less the relationships of various characters to each other. \rPlayers use the controls to move Harry\u2019s wand in patterns to cast spells. Since this isn\u2019t a combat-heavy game, the wand-work is used mostly to manipulate the environment and solve puzzles. The Nintendo Wii\u2019s motion-sensing controller gives spell-casting a new dimension that children will enjoy, but the magic system works just as well with the traditional controls on other systems.\r\u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d is easily the best Harry Potter game yet. While that\u2019s hardly high praise, it\u2019s nice to see Electronic Arts has finally infused the series with some creative energy beyond simply aping the plot of a movie and licensing the likeness of its actors.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.649084, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "body": "With \u201c<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d Electronic Arts is trying something different.

He's already flaunted plenty of his influences on stage and screen, and eventually, he may get around to all of them. But on Friday night at the Greek Theater, one could say that Harry Connick came home -- back to N'Awlins -- and he performed with the easy, casual assurance of someone who was glad to be back.\nIt took a cataclysmic jolt of nature and history to bring Connick home -- and that jolt, of course, was Katrina. Now New Orleans is the focus of his act, right down to the French Quarter-styled street lamps, ceiling fans, background projections and battered, jangling upright piano (along with the Steinway grand and B3 organ).\nMost of the songs were New Orleans-related standards in various genres -- from the local tourist board's definition of jazz (\"Sugar Blues,\" \"Basin Street Blues,\" \"Didn't He Ramble\") to Louis Armstrong vehicles (\"Hello Dolly!,\" \"When It's Sleepy Time Down South\") and the funky-funky soul of Allen Toussaint (\"Working in the Coal Mine,\" \"Yes We Can Can\").\nConnick's thumping piano style fit particularly well in just about all of them, while his vocals were ingratiating, if not always fulfilling, reminders of the original, earthier performers. He still takes good care of business in all aspects of his two-hour act -- fine pacing; excellent sound quality; sharp, crisp, traditional big-band charts (presumably written by him). He also continues to spar engagingly with the sly, expert, plunger- and hand-muted brass solos of Leroy Jones (trumpet) and Lucien Barbarin (trombone).\nYet Katrina also may have focused Connick in a deeper sense; he seemed more serious, less cocky, less prone to breezy ingratiating banter (although he did slip back into the latter mode for a short while late in the show). He brought forth a new self-penned song -- a good, melancholy one -- about the plight of his shamefully neglected hometown, sung with more passion than anything else on the program. Never one to despair for long, Connick followed it up with \"Yes We Can Can's\" infectious message of hope.\nNot all of the show was a celebration of New Orleans, for Connick still feels the undertow of his recent, successful starring role in \"The Pajama Game\" on Broadway. He was eager to show off two of his souvenirs from the show, \"Hey There\" and the sexy opening lines of \"Small Talk,\" now decked out in new big-band arrangements.\nOtherwise, Connick was home.

In \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" the budding teenage wizards-in-training grapple with incipient romance, jealousy and mortality. Last year's \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" seemed dark, but this excellent fourth film derived from J.K. Rowling's books is the darkest \"Potter\" yet, intense enough to warrant a PG-13 rating. This factor alone will prompt another modest dip in franchise B.O. performance, as some younger viewers will steer clear, at least until homevid release. But pic's excitement and quality bode well for sustained fan interest and confidence through the enterprise's remaining three installments.\rWorldwide theatrical gross for the three features stands at a staggering $2.6 billion, although totals have dropped with each subsequent film, from $974 million for \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" to $879 million for \"The Chamber of Secrets\" to $749 million for \"Azkaban.\"\rAfter Mexican helmer Alfonso Cuaron elevated the series so considerably last year, producer David Heyman gave a second chance to Mike Newell, who turned down \"Sorcerer's Stone.\" Newell becomes the first English director to have a go at Harry, and he doesn't let the home team down.\rThe books' millions of readers, youthful and otherwise, will know what's coming: the emergence of Lord Voldemort, the ubervillain who killed Harry's parents, was later sapped of his powers by the tyke but has now concocted an ingenious plan to trap his nemesis at the conclusion of the interschool Triwizard Tournament.\rScreenwriter Steve Kloves, faced with the task of boiling the 734-page book down to manageable length (157-minute running time makes it the second-longest \"Potter\" picture, after \"Chamber\"), makes short work of Rowling's bloated 157-page prologue devoted to the Quidditch World Cup. In economical fashion, pic reels off Harry's nightmare about Voldemort's return, his journey to the White Cliffs with Hermione and the Weasleys to attend the match (in an astonishing modern stadium), the fiery assault on the wizards' massive tent city by the Voldemort's Death Eaters (outfitted in pointy Klan-style hats) and the threatening apparition of Voldemort's Dark Mark -- a ghostly skull and snake -- in the night sky.\rAfter just 14 minutes, we're back on the Hogwarts Express with the Fourth Years, all noticeably taller, older and more mature than in the last installment. That this year will be different from all previous years is announced by the arrival of a flying-horse-drawn carriage bearing the French female students of Beauxbatons, and the emergence from under the lake of a vintage sailing ship carrying the Middle European boys from Durmstrang. \rAs Dumbledore explains, this exercise in international cooperation among wizarding schools is meant to foster the age-old tradition of the Triwizard Tournament, a trio of daunting tasks to be undertaken by an exemplary representative from each institution.\rGeneral acclamation greets the selection of the representatives of the three schools: rangy Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, foxy Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons and macho Quidditch ace Viktor Krum from Durmstrang. But the selection of a surprise fourth contestant -- none other than Harry Potter -- creates tremendous consternation, as he's underage and seemingly unprepared for the arduous tasks. Even Harry and Dumbledore are upset, as no one has a clue who submitted Harry's name for the competition.\rWith so much ground to cover, Kloves has had to eliminate many story elements readers may be expecting. Absent or significantly reduced are many of the early films' cutesier motifs, such as the animated paintings and ghostly inhabitants (with the delightful exception of Shirley Henderson's Moaning Myrtle). The yarn has been streamlined so that even such significant developments as Harry and Ron's falling out are compressed.\rThe upside is that the filmmakers keep the narrative screws fastened tight, which gives \"The Goblet of Fire\" an intensity that rarely flags. From the creepy, desaturated rural opening that recalls David Lean's Dickens films to the exceptionally credible integration of effects into the live action, Newell tries to find the emotional reality in material that, until now, has been used more to showcase fantasy and wonder.\rAltered emphasis requires more of Daniel Radcliffe, and he rises to the occasion with a more dimensional and nuanced performance as Harry. Having now passed decisively into adolescence, he suggests for the first time there actually may be an actor in him, as he seems more aware of, and responsive to, everything going on around him.\rRupert Grint's Ron is another matter, as the thesp seems caught at an unappealingly awkward stage and must spend much of the time sulking over Harry's and Hermione's perceived slights. And why do Ron and even Harry wear their hair so uncommonly long? Ron's flowing red locks, in particular, all but obscure his face at times and make him look like a ruddy sheepdog.\rEmma Watson's studious Hermione comes into her own at the fabulous Christmas ball, which provides a breather after the first task, in which Harry does battle with a fearsome Hungarian Horntail dragon in a gripping sequence that will have small fry ducking for cover.\rThe cross-currents running up to the ball make for a mini teen melodrama, with Harry keen on Asian student Cho, Ron into Hermione and the latter coy about the identity of her date until she resplendently turns up on the arm of Quidditch ace Krum. \rSecond task is an underwater affair with bizarre creatures that don't measure up to the others on hand, while the third is a massive maze that leads Harry to a long-awaited showdown with the renascent Voldemort. Pale, hairless and noseless save for nostril slits, Ralph Fiennes makes the series' villain-of-villains a distinctive monster, remorseless and cunning, in a climactic scene that does not disappoint and will, like the dragon, prove frightening to impressionable youngsters.\rThe other memorable addition here is Brendan Gleeson's \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Brandishing large scars, a detachable leg, an ever-ready flask, an all-seeing zoom-lens false eye and an irascible attitude, Moody is one of Rowling's most colorful creations, and Gleeson makes him all the more so.\rExcept for Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, who becomes more central than ever, some of the other delightful regulars get reduced screen time, including Maggie Smith's McGonagall, Alan Rickman's Snape and Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, who enjoys a romance with Frances de la Tour's Madame Maxime, the head of Beauxbaton, who's even taller than he. A semblance of Gary Oldman's Sirius Black appears in a scene among burning embers in a fireplace.\rMiranda Richardson hits mostly obvious notes as the scandal-hungry journalist Rita Skeeter, while Roger Lloyd Pack's Barty Crouch is a superbly drawn figure, a Ministry of Magic official who conjures up an astonishing combination of Neville Chamberlain and -- due to the moustache -- Hitler. David Tennant is fierce as the renegade Barty junior.\rTechnical aspects are of the expected high standard, with many hands, including production designer Stuart Craig, cinematographer Roger Pratt, costume designer Jany Temime, creature and makeup effects designer Nick Dudman, visual effects supervisor Jimmy Mitchell and special effects supervisor John Richardson, returning from previous \"Potter\" duties.\rNew to the team are editor Mick Audsley and, most conspicuously, composer Patrick Doyle, who briefly works in themes from previous John Williams scores, albeit in a minor, dissonant mode, but otherwise employs rich strings and a more classical frame of reference to endow this installment with fresh emotional amplification and disturbing undercurrents.\rVery slowly unspooling end credits run 13 minutes, surely somewhere near the record.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.623795, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "body": "No more kids&#x27; stuff at Hogwarts.

Ginell", "popularity": 1, "body": "From a brash New Orleans teenager with a heavy, thumping piano style, Harry Connick Jr. has evolved over two decades into a multiple-threat entertainer. Besides playing the piano, he sings, he banters, he charms, he dances a little, he leads a solidly swinging big band, he even arranges and conducts. It was more than enough activity to carry an engaging, uninterrupted two-hour show Friday night -- and his name recognition remained high enough to pack the Hollywood Bowl (Friday's attendance was 16,583, a few hundred short of a sellout).\nConnick knocks himself out to entertain an audience, but he does so with an easy, insouciant grace that conceals the effort behind the act. He can lay on the New Orleans charm like honey, bantering his way out of a blown lyric on \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" or sauntering out onto the walkway around the Pool Circle to josh with security guards and surprised members of the audience.\nUnderneath the crowd-pleasing, though, the guy clearly knows how to put together an act; the proof is in the supporting details. His songs were conventional yet undeniably well-crafted in a Basie-derived fashion, and the big band was obviously well drilled, delivering tunes with bite and pizzazz.\nConnick realizes the importance of having a superb drummer aboard -- and the man on the spot was the redoubtable Jeff \"Tain\" Watts, longtime cohort of the Marsalis dynasty, who generated a powerful swinging groove that lifted all ships.\nThe lighting effects were consistently eye-catching, and even the sound was mostly first-rate -- and noticeably better than earlier in the new Bowl shell's inaugural season.\nConnick was careful to cater to the jazz fans in the crowd, too. In addition to his own piano solos -- still in a stabbing manner but with the excesses trimmed back and pushed along nicely by the rhythm section -- trumpeter Leroy Jones and trombonist Lucien Barbarin received plenty of worthwhile solo time.\nYet while you can't help liking the guy and admiring his versatility, there is something about this act that does not quite connect on a deeper emotional level, and the root lies in the vocals. Maybe it's not fair to compare the Connick effect with that of the immortal Sinatra, but he continues to set himself up for the comparison with his Sinatra-like vocal phrasing and timbre -- and it remains a facsimile, nothing more. Connick is an entertainer, and a good one, but he's not in the icon class.\nDoug Wamble opened the show with a brief sampling of his lazy, bluesy strummed guitar and decent vocals.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.607138, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "body": "From a brash New Orleans teenager with a heavy, thumping piano style, <em>Harry</em> Connick Jr. has evolved over two decades into a multiple-threat entertainer.

The reason for the change: Marcy Kahan's adaptation of the Nora Ephron screenplay finally has leads who can land the material. Now you're actually rooting for Harry and Sally, rather than pondering the lows to which the West End will stoop to bring any breathing American actor to the London stage.\rMolly Ringwald isn't just any old actor: by now, she's something of a seasoned stage performer, even if she hasn't exactly been ideal in either of the Broadway shows (\"Cabaret\" and \"Enchanted April\") in which I've seen her. As Sally, the beguiling fusspot famously originated in Rob Reiner's movie by a frizzy-haired Meg Ryan, Ringwald warms up a role that was given an insistently shrill treatment by Alyson Hannigan back in February. Although far too old for the newly arrived Manhattanite of the opening scene, Ringwald goes on to suggest the inbuilt ache of a single woman who wants everything \"on the side.\" Except, that is, for love, where she craves the main course.\rThe problem: Her eventual intended, the none-too-sharkish corporate lawyer Harry, is a sexual triathlete with a serious commitment problem. As first envisioned by Ephron and retained in Kahan's stop-start adaptation, Harry can joke and riff with the best of them, and God knows he has charm. But he won't utter the L-word lest it tie him down, when he prefers to be the first person out the door the morning after.\rRingwald -- in her British stage debut -- is clearly the name attraction this time around, but it's Michael Landes' Harry who is the discovery, particularly if you've never caught his TV stints in \"Lois and Clark\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" (I hadn't). In physical terms, he's a darker-featured variant on Luke Perry, who opened in the part. More importantly, Landes is infinitely more comfortable with the script's casual, knockabout humor, whether he's mulling the opaque meaning to the lyrics of \"Auld Lang Syne\" or pondering the efficacy of fathering children when you are in your 70s: What happens if you are too old to pick them up?\rThe result is to put the audience in the position of the play's second bananas, Jack (a delightful Dexter Fletcher) and Marie (Susannah Wise, saddled with a British thesp's standard-issue Brooklynese), the best friends who see the leads' potential for coupledom well before Harry and Sally themselves do. Although Landes' Harry is very funny enumerating for Jack and Marie the pitfalls that inevitably attend romance, the joke is, of course, on him: He's the master tactician who can delay the inevitable by talking the talk, while Jack and Marie simply take the plunge.\rThe whole show feels more human now, notwithstanding a severely geometric design by Ultz that remains cruelly clinical given the subject matter at hand. As before, the scenes are rather shapeless and piecemeal, and the ending is still missing the directorial punctuation that might help deliver it to the audience. (Loveday Ingram is the helmer.)\rBut you're with Harry and Sally in a way that wasn't true the first time around, right down to the final video footage of the pair now settled into domestic life, complete with child. Ringwald, in the film, looks like a happy mother.

Visually dazzling and considerably darker than the prior incarnations, the story suffers from a slightly disjointed feel that will prove less accessible to those not intimately familiar with every corner of author J.K. Rowling's world. Pent-up demand after an 18-month hiatus should ensure magical returns initially, but the unwieldy elements make it less likely Warner Bros. can conjure up the kind of box office staying power exhibited by the \"Potter\" predecessors.\rOn paper, Alfonso Cuaron represented an inspired choice to inherit the series -- his most salient credit being not indie darling \"Y tu mama tambien\" but rather his radiant 1995 children's story \"A Little Princess.\" In terms of style, the director immediately puts his stamp on the material by delivering a bold shift in the film's color palette, using muted, washed-out tones that help capture a sense of wonder and foreboding.\rThe problem is that both the narrative and Cuaron's flourishes mark a rather stark departure from Chris Columbus' approach of closely adhering to the books, which played better with children than this film is apt to while still appealing to adults. Notably lacking is the sort of action-oriented climax that punctuated the earlier films, as \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" closes with a cerebral time-traveling interlude that nearly requires a crash-course in \"Terminator\" logic.\rRowling's ever-growing novels have exacerbated the adaptation process for Cuaron and writer Steve Kloves (who has scripted all three films), demanding tough choices in terms of what to keep and what to throw away. And while Potter aficionados should be able to knot the story strands, others might find the connections a bit fuzzy.\rEntering his third year at Hogwarts school for budding wizards, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) once again is found with his disapproving Muggle family, the Dursleys, exacting magical vengeance on an unwelcome guest who winds up resembling Mr. Creosote in Monty Python's \"The Meaning of Life.\"\rSoon, Harry is whisked back to school, en route learning of the escape of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) -- a criminal jailed for a dozen years in the prison of Azkaban for having conspired with the dreaded Lord Voldemort to do in Harry's parents.\rThe story takes some time reassembling familiar faces, from Harry's buddies Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to nemesis Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his entourage, all of whom display signs of growing older in varying (and not always flattering) degrees.\rThe cast additions include the latest teacher of defense against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), and a slightly daft professor of divination played by Emma Thompson, who dives in with relish behind finger-thick glasses.\rAnother key addition is only a new face of sorts, as Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Harry's mentor, Albus Dumbledore, providing a somewhat less warm and avuncular presence.\rUnfortunately, beyond the threat posed by Black's inevitable return, the pic is lacking in a strong through-line. Ghastly creatures called Dementors are unleashed to capture the fugitive, and a werewolf is on the loose. Meanwhile, the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) introduces students to a Hippogriff -- a Harryhausen-esque eagle-horse hybrid whose soaring feats represent the film's artistic apex.\rClearly, there's laudable ambition in wedding a director like Cuaron with a large-scale summer entertainment, but the Potter mythology -- from the assortment of characters that require servicing to the sometimes-confounding rules of wizardry -- tie his hands to an extent. In a sense, each new layer tacked on complicates the juggling act, even with a less rigid and literal devotion to the source than Columbus employed.\rWhat emerges, then, has its thrilling and even beautiful moments but never quite coalesces into a fully realized story. As such, \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" is actually the shortest of the three films, yet at times feels like the longest.\rThat's no fault of the talented young performers, who are ably growing up with their pubescent characters, including Ron's growing discomfort around Hermione. Thewlis is also fine as the most prominently featured adult, while Oldman does what he can with relatively scant screen time.\rOnce again, the production is technically superior, with the grimmer tone reflected even in John Williams' score, which seems to heighten the sense of menace in its elfin theme. The one disappointment comes in the form of the werewolf, a gangly apparition that looks more cartoonish, and less fearsome, than it ought to be.\rWith a sixth \"Harry Potter\" novel still to come, there's hardly a danger of the franchise disappearing. And while there's no pleasure in seeing a studio possibly penalized, in essence, for setting its creative sights higher than might have been anticipated, \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" could provide a reminder of the pitfalls in that strategy -- namely, that adjusting one's aim also risks not quite hitting the target.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.605225, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "body": "Much like a child going through puberty, the maturation of the <em>Harry</em> Potter franchise has yielded awkward growing pains for the third film in the series.

But to ask them to vie with the memories of Meg Ryan and, especially, Billy Crystal (in his best screen perf), is about as absurd as representing Manhattan by the faceless, antiseptic rectangular box that passes for designer Ultz's set.\nThe design, however, is the least of the problems in scribe Marcy Kahan's theatrical replication (adaptation hardly seems the word) of Nora Ephron's screenplay about the long, slow road to romance across a dozen-plus years of Harry (Perry) and Sally (Hannigan). Harry, you see, loves sex and likes to boast of his prowess at it, but he shies away from the real commitment -- the desire to make love -- that defines the perky, fastidious Sally.\nAs Shakespeare often made clear in his comedies, sparring can be the most logical precursor to passion, and there's a genial amiability about the arc of a narrative that lands where any onlooker could have anticipated from the start: with Harry and Sally locked in a decisive, lasting clinch. (Although that embrace, in director Loveday Ingram's maladroit handling of it, is so far from celebratory that the audience seemed confused as to whether to applaud.)\nThe two have jobs, sort of: She as a journalist, he as a corporate lawyer who may not be quite sharkish enough for that milieu. And yet their careers are nothing when set against the parry-and-thrust of opposites who, in time-honored fashion, must eventually attract. What drives Harry to distraction about Sally -- At a restaurant, must she always order everything on the side? -- is what ultimately endears her to him, even if their friends, Jack (Jake Broder) and Marie (Sharon Small), turn out, amusingly, to be far quicker off the amorous mark.\nThe movie is arguably the most Woody Allenish of films not to have anything to do with the Woodman and, watching it again, one is struck by the pathos that Crystal brings to the wisecracking yet emotionally cautious Harry. Perry looks great -- indeed, he's almost too much the heartthrob for the lines he's been given -- but he's in no way right for the role. More your standard-issue jock, his Harry hardly seems the type to indulge heated debates about \"Casablanca\" and karaoke renditions of songs from \"Oklahoma!\" It's odd, too, to hear the Jewish zing of the repartee quite so de-ethnicized, which in turn has the effect of making it seem as if Perry knows the words but can't land the rhythmic cadences of them.\nHannigan's response to a similar problem is mostly to speak louder: For a first-time theater practitioner (Perry at least did a Broadway stand in the \"Rocky Horror\" revival), she has no trouble reaching the back wall of the Theater Royal, Haymarket. The odd result, however, is to make the opening half-hour or so sound as if the two stars are acting at totally different volumes: You want to turn one up even or turn the other one down. (The discrepancy eased up after the intermission.) But playing a woman who worries that she will be \"40, someday,\" Hannigan tends to be hard-edged and slightly shrill where Meg Ryan was famously dizzy and warm.\nSmall wonder that before long, one's attentions have shifted to the tale's secondary couple, with the portly, effortlessly funny Broder suggesting himself as a natural Harry. Except, of course, that he isn't a big name.\nSpectators may enjoy making direct comparisons of the screen and stage scripts: the way the movie's opening car ride from Chicago to New York, for instance, has been eliminated in favor of a starting gambit in which Harry arrives to paint the apartment of new Manhattanite Sally, whose sensitivities toward urban living lead to a neat gag about the multiple locks on her front door. Many of Ephron's best lines remain intact: An apt riff on the time that could be saved if real estate ads were combined with obits (Perry doesn't mine that one for anywhere near its full value), or a delicious exchange about Charlie Chaplin becoming a parent in his 70s.\nOddly, the famous \"I'll have what she's having\" moment -- delivered with movie-stealing gusto onscreen by director Rob Reiner's mother -- is here given to a swishy male reveler seated near Harry and Sally. The entire restaurant scene, Hannigan's impressive orgasmic moaning notwithstanding, is so fussily staged that its, uh, climactic line is all but lost.\nThe \"how we met\" film sequences, meanwhile, have been updated for the 21st century: There's a gay couple who tell of meeting during \"Der Rosenkavalier\" at the Met and a black couple who fell in love at 12.

Darker and more dramatic, this account of Harry's troubled second year at Hogwarts may be a bit overlong and unmodulated in pacing, but it possesses a confidence and intermittent flair that begin to give it a life of its own apart of the literary franchise, something the initial picture never achieved. With Pottermania perhaps having cooled over the course of a year from the heat level of a burning furnace to that of a happily bubbling cauldron, it can't be expected that \"Chamber of Secrets\" will hit the dizzying commercial heights of \"Sorcerer's Stone,\" which at $967 million total gross ($317.6 million from the U.S.) stands as the No. 2 worldwide B.O. hit of all time. But its mammoth success remains a foregone conclusion.\rJust as author J.K. Rowling assumed a certain reader knowledge in her second book (published in 1999), so do returning director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves rightly presume to pare exposition down to the minimum this time out (it's hard to imagine anyone seeing this who hasn't caught the original). So it's only a matter of about 20 minutes until Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), who has endured a dispiriting summer as a virtual prisoner at the suburban home of his dreadfully conventional uncle and aunt, is off again to Hogwarts to resume his study of witchcraft and wizardry.\rHappily, a good part of the buildup is spent back at Diagon Alley, where Harry first encounters Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, so ideally cast you'd think Rowling wrote the character with him in mind). The preening author of the autobiography \"Magical Me,\" Lockhart is joining the Hogwarts faculty as teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Also entering the stage for the first time is Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), the blond-tressed, evil-oozing father of Harry's school archrival, Draco.\rMysteriously prevented from passing through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross station, Harry and his best friend, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), are forced to travel by car -- Ron's dad's flying Ford Anglia, to be specific -- which lands the boys safely on the school grounds, but none too smoothly in the mighty branches of an ancient tree that takes great offense at the intrusion.\rAlthough Harry's voice has dropped an octave or so since the first year, he's not really a teenager yet; all the same, there is a new ardor in his excitement over reuniting with Hermione (Emma Watson), the top student in their class. Aptly, Harry, Ron and Hermione seem more truly and enthusiastically like best friends and co-conspirators this time around; a little self-consciousness is evident, and the young leading thesps indulge in moments of spontaneity that reassuringly suggest they now feel more at home in their roles.\rAlthough Hogwarts is still dominated by the same figures --headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and Hagrid the Giant (Robbie Coltrane) -- and classes begin promisingly with Lockhart and the new professor of Herbology, Sprout (Miriam Margolyes), who performs a particularly amusing demonstration of the proper method of topping mandrakes, all is not well. Harry starts hearing a malevolent voice of unknown origin urging him to kill, and a pet cat is found hanging in a hallway.\rThese and subsequent events, in which students are found \"petrified,\" lead to speculation about Hogwarts' legendary Chamber of Secrets, which is thought to have been reopened. Professor McGonagall tells her charges such a chamber, the alleged home of a terrifying monster, has never been found, which only encourages Harry, Ron and Hermione to dig into its mysteries.\rConflict hinges on the supposition that whoever opened the chamber must be the descendent of Salazar Slytherin, the renegade co-founder of Hogwarts who insisted only pure-blooded wizards and witches should be permitted at the school. Suspicion naturally falls upon Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), whose father is ardently committed to ridding the institution of \"Muggles,\" or the children of normal human beings; to this end, Hermione begins preparing an exotic potion to enable her and her two friends to interrogate Draco on the subject.\rBut the possibility cannot be ignored that, in the manner of \"Star Wars'\" Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter himself is the unknowing descendent of the most accomplished and evil wizard on the books. Certainly others think so; Harry conveniently turns up wherever an unseemly incident occurs, and he surprises even himself by being a Parselmouth, someone able to converse with a snake.\rIn a nicely rendered sepia sequence, Harry learns a good deal from the \"interactive\" diary of a long-ago student named Tom Riddle, whose exploits in the chamber reveal the involvement of Hagrid and Dumbledore and the portentous escape of a spider. When Hermione becomes petrified and is removed to hospital, and the school's very existence becomes threatened by all the disturbances, Harry and Ron undertake a visit to Hagrid's, then to a spider-infested forest, to crack the puzzle.\rUltimately, however, Harry must enter the chamber himself and sword in hand, Siegfried-style, confront the beast. The nocturnal spider sequence will spawn many a childhood nightmare, to be sure, but the climactic serpent battle packs genuine tension; differentiating between this PG-rated action and that in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,\" which earned a PG-13, is an exercise in hair-splitting. In any event, parents might want to think twice about taking genuine small fry along to \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\rWith the newfound confidence shown by Columbus and the continued shrewd stewardship of producer David Heyman, improvements over the first film are to be found in all departments. Cinematographer Roger Pratt (\"Batman,\" \"The End of the Affair\"), taking over from John Seale, whose strength always has been location lensing rather than studio lighting, has Columbus moving the camera much more than before, which gives the film increased momentum and visual energy; greater contrasts between light and shadow add a darker tone.\rProduction designer Stuart Craig, whose splendid work was perhaps the felicitous highlight of \"Sorcerer's Stone,\" adds to his accomplishment here with superb creations for Dumbledore's office, the spider's lair and the massive chamber itself. New costume designer Lindy Hemming (\"Topsy Turvy\") has added to the imaginative costumes established by Judianna Makovsky with witty creations for the showy Lockhart and the sinister Lucius, among others. Even the new Quidditch match is better achieved than the blandly computerized-looking counterpart the first time out.\rThe greatest relief of all: The volume and aggressiveness of John Williams' calamitous score for the original has been reduced several times over, to the point where the musical accompaniment, which still remains more ever-present than absolutely necessary, nonetheless functions in a properly supportive and helpful manner.\rNear-epic running time, which filmmakers might rationalize as necessary to accommodate all the essential incidents of the novel, might prove wearying to some, but won't be a barrier; at 161 minutes, pic is nine minutes longer than \"Sorcerer's Stone,\" although final credits run a full 10 minutes. At the end of them is a very short filmed coda revealing the humorous fate of one of the principals.\rA more muscular filmmaker might have made the film seem to pass more quickly via imaginative pacing -- Columbus gives every scene equal weight and never varies the tempo -- but pic is not likely to induce active squirming despite the length. However, if Kloves' scripts are to remain as all-inclusively faithful to the novels as the first two have been, one has to begin worrying about the running\ntimes of the forthcoming productions, given the massively expanding length of the books.\rIn addition to the welcome contributions of series newcomers Branagh, Margolyes and Isaacs, film features a commanding turn by Christian Coulson as the mysterious Tom Riddle. Rather less enchanting is a CGI creature named Dobby, the elfin servant of Lucius who at intervals imparts crucial information to Harry but, in the way he annoyingly prattles on and on, threatens to become the Jar Jar Binks of the Potter series. By contrast, some of the other creatures, notably the mandrakes and the serpentine Basilisk, are splendidly realized.\rWhile the late Richard Harris plays a much more significant role than he did in the first entry and seizes opportunities to inject whimsy when possible, it must be said that he looks none too well here: The voice is weak, the skin noticeably pale even with all the makeup.\rFor the next series entry, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" which begins production next spring and therefore won't be ready for holiday release a year hence, Alfonso Cuaron will assume the directorial reins from Columbus, who will remain as exec producer. It's a prospect that has fans curious already as to the different inflections the talented Mexican helmer might bring to this very British franchise. In the meantime, the series has already taken a step in the right direction.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.588392, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", "body": "While &quot;<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; may slavishly adhere to its source novel nearly as much as its predecessor did, it is on every count a better movie than last year&#x27;s first film installment in the telling of the story of a young wizard&#x27;s startling education.

Thirteen years later, Connick at age 34 displays seasoning, poise and maturity. He is less brash and much savvier. A true renaissance man, Connick covers all corners of his profession. He is a mellow crooner, a hot and less destructive jazz pianist, a hip big band front man, a film actor (his latest pic, \"The Simian Line,\" opened in theaters last week), and this season he has made his debut as a Broadway composer of promise.\nAt the City Center, Connick led a crackling 15-piece big band. Citing his recent Broadway debut, the composer tagged \"Thou Shalt Not\" as a musical that celebrates \"adultery, murder and inbreeding.\" Sampling the show's score, Connick related the murky Emile Zola tale that finds the ghost of a murdered victim returning to haunt his wife and her lover with a swaggering and infectious observation, \"Oh, Ain't That Sweet!\" \nNot yet accustomed to the process of creating a show and the concentrated teamwork involved, Connick was disheartened that one song, \"Something's Gone Wrong,\" was dropped from the score. Too good to be buried in his trunk, it settles nicely into the tour repertoire.\nThe winter tour celebrates the release of two Columbia CDs, \"Songs I Heard\" and \"Thirty,\" the former a kid song mix for grown-ups. Connick tapped the collection for his concert with some \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Wizard of Oz\" excerpts, including that fanciful rare Harold Arlen outtake, \"The Jitterbug,\" a jaunty account of a giant pink mosquito. Highlight in this segment was the Anthony Newley-Leslie Bricusse medley of \"Pure Imagination\" and \"The Candy Man.\"\nVariety from a richly embroidered symphonic piano solo of Nino Rota's \"Godfather\" theme to torchy takes on \"Cry Me a River\" and \"That Old Black Magic\" affirmed his allegiance to the standards. The latter spins round and round with the kind of traditional balladry Connick has mastered so keenly. Connick coolly demonstrated that a Johnny Mercer lyric or an Arlen melody is never out of style.\nThe New Orleans native was at his best with \"That's a Plenty,\" \"Bourbon Street Parade\" and the Fats Domino jump tune \"I'm Walkin'.\" Connick's piano perf can best be described as a Crescent City mix of stride, boogie and Dixieland, plus a heady dash of down home rhythm and blues. A kind of homage to Louis Armstrong fell into place with \"Some Day, You'll be Sorry,\" and Connick sang it without extra dressing. The purity and directness of his reading defined the knowing subtlety of his art.\nConnick, a generous host, gave blues guitarist Jonathan Dubose, trumpeter Leroy Jones and Stephen Riley on tenor sax plenty of room to stretch.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.579166, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "body": "When <em>Harry</em> Connick Jr. made his debut as a solo artist at Manhattan&#x27;s venerable Oak Room more than a decade ago, his vigorous barrelhouse piano wizardry resulted in the popping of two strings that sailed out of the grand like a near lethal whip.

For the tens of millions of fans the world over who have taken J.K. Rowling's marvelously imaginative 1997 novel (and its three sequels thus far) to their hearts, Warner Bros.' smartly produced and elaborately manufactured $125 million-plus visualization will essentially make their dreams come true -- the script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine. That the picture never takes on a life or soul of its own is another matter that will have little or no bearing on how many times youngsters and even adults will return to this high-flying entertainment that looks poised to become one of the biggest-grossing films of all time.\nIn historical terms, the most surprising but apt comparison to be drawn is with \"Gone With the Wind,\" another literary sensation that spawned a film version that had to meet similarly demanding public expectations. In both cases, everyone had an opinion about the casting, which ultimately turned out brilliantly; the authors (both female, coincidentally) desired a fidelity to the text, which was honored; directors were hired who could be counted upon to obediently serve the material; vast sums were spent to create the physical worlds of the novels, and the producers bucked conventional thinking about running time to include all the necessary incidents. Then as now, the result would seem to be exactly what the eager public is waiting for.\nFrom the point of view of protecting and thus maximizing the franchise, one must acknowledge the smarts of producer David Heyman and Warner Bros. in making all the right decisions, from keeping it \"British\" to realizing that a high-powered and personal filmmaker (such as Steven Spielberg or Terry Gilliam, both of whom were up for the job) was not only unnecessary but actually undesirable, given that textual alterations and idiosyncratic flights of fancy would have been distracting at best and irritating at worst for the intended audience. This \"Harry Potter\" is therefore a product more than a film or, as the text would have it, a Voldemort required to leech off another being in order to stay alive.\nSteve Kloves' carefully accomplished screenplay begins, reassuringly, with a condensed version of the book's opening: On a quiet suburban London street, owls appear, a magician saps the light out of street lamps, a cat turns into a woman resembling a witch and a bearded giant delivers a bundled tyke to a doorstep.\nThe boy, of course, is Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), an orphan who remains remarkably cheerful in the face of the endless resentment and abuse dispensed by the small-minded uncle and aunt with whom he's been left; he's kept in a cupboard under the stairs, is tortured by his bully cousin and isn't allowed to open the formally addressed envelopes that mysteriously begin arriving for him. The Dursleys are shocked when the same giant, Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), turns up on Harry's 11th birthday to inform the lad that he is actually the son of two murdered wizards and now is welcome to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry.\nEven from this introductory stretch, however, it's obvious that director Chris Columbus positions his camera very arbitrarily and has little idea how to stage action dramatically or visually build to climaxes, relying instead on special effects and John Williams' infernally busy score to punch up key moments. But again, no matter, as we are swept off into a magical world that has been physicalized to an extraordinarily appealing degree by the work of production designer Stuart Craig and his vast team, the locations, the effects and actors.\nMost important among the latter, of course, is Radcliffe. The boy's regular features, slightly shaggy dark hair, clear eyes and round specs make him instantly embraceable as Harry, and his performance goes on to strike the right balance between normal, but not exceptional, brightness and the gradual understanding of the extraordinary powers he possesses. One of the film's most delightful interludes is Harry's shopping tour with Hagrid through colorful Diagon Alley, where the bank is staffed by some fabulously crabby goblins that Charles Dickens might have appreciated. Harry obtains his wand from a wizened old clerk (John Hurt) who knew his father and Hagrid makes a withdrawal of the titular rock (called the \"Philosopher's Stone\" in the English edition of both book and film) to spirit back to Hogwarts for safe keeping.\nThe edifying sense of the novel materializing before one's eyes is maintained when Harry is directed to Track 9\u00be to catch the special express train that will take him and his fellow first-year students Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) to Hogwarts. When, at 40 minutes in, the school is at last seen, with the kids rowing across a lake at night toward its towering turrets and spires sitting upon a fortress-like promontory, the film's desired sense of wonder and mystery about what lies ahead sets in.\nThe \"witch\" of the prologue reappears as Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), who presides over the all-important \"sorting\" of students among four houses adjudicated in the massive, candle-and-torch-lit Great Hall by a delightful talking hat. Harry, Ron and Hermione end up together in Gryffindor, while their little nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is assigned to Slytherin, where the frightening Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) holds sway. Magically, a feast appears on the long tables, ghosts charmingly flit about, paintings come to life and the stairways switch positions without warning.\nAt his first flying lesson, Harry is discovered to be so adept at maneuvering a broomstick that he's made the \"seeker\" on the Gryffindor team in the game of Quidditch, a fabulously dangerous sport that sees the players darting above an arena on brooms in pursuit of some high-velocity hard balls. The flying part is superbly pulled off visually, but the Quidditch match itself, while absorbing to watch, is the only sequence that features an off-putting CGI feel, as the camera moves are far too precise and measured and the backgrounds look too clean.\nIn the course of a highly eventful school year, a central issue emerges: It seems that someone evil, very likely Snape, is plotting to steal the Sorcerer's Stone on behalf of Voldemort, a supreme wizard who went over to the Dark Side but has been short on power since he killed Harry's parents but couldn't quite finish off the boy. As they learn more, the kids realize the stone lies beyond a trap door guarded by a monstrous three-headed dog incongruously named Fluffy.\nIn a crammed succession of events that jumps directly from such book high points as Harry's nocturnal wanderings in his invisibility cloak (very nifty) and seeing his late parents in a magic mirror to slipping past Fluffy into the Devil's Snare of binding tendrils and a life-sized chessboard, the youthful trio has its courage and ingenuity tested to the extreme in a battle of overt good and evil.\nThis latter section, while frequently eye-popping and likely scare-inducing for little kids, flattens out the narrative due to the lack of dramatic modulation, and the chess match unfortunately emphasizes violence over suspense. Making matters much worse is Williams' hyperactive musical score, which thunders over everything, never takes a rest and is completely uninterested in developing any emotional themes to evoke Harry's inner life of parental longing. Half as much music would have been more than enough, at half the volume.\nBut the cast compensates in spades, particularly the adorably effusive Watson as the bright and inquisitive Hermione, and Grint, whose Ron Weasley develops nicely from a second banana into a valuable warrior for good. On the adult side, Coltrane is perhaps first among equals as the outsized Hagrid, but it is no surprise how ideally such pros as Smith, Rickman, Hurt, Richard Harris as the white-maned Professor Dumbledore, Ian Hart as the mysterious Professor Quirrell and Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw as the anxiously normal Dursleys fit their roles.\nThe extensive effects, which reportedly consumed nearly half the film's budget and were farmed out to nine credited effects houses internationally under the overall supervision of Robert Legato, are generally outstanding and enjoyable; some of the creature work, such as the centaur, even evokes the stop-motion work of pioneer Ray Harryhausen. Judianna Markovsky's costume designs are also a source of continual pleasure, while John Seale's widescreen lensing handsomely spreads the action across the screen.

Gracefully blending dirt realism with oneiric mysticism, and tragedy with a rich vein of humor, this dark ditty should put down roots in sophisticated arthouse markets.\nCarrying a considerable portion of the dramatic weight single-handedly and effortlessly embodying the marriage of whimsy, menace and madness that constitutes the film's singular tone is Colm Meaney in the title role. While the actor has been known to overplay the boisterous Irish wild man at times -- in Stephen Frears' heavy-handed \"The Van\" for one -- his performance here is controlled and complex, as much a sad victim of the character's own deranged obsession as he is a loose cannon wreaking havoc on enemies and loved ones alike.\nA cabbage farmer in the tiny village of Stilton, Harry (Meaney) is tormented by a recurring dream in which he is transformed into a tree and then chopped down for wood to make coffins. Having lost his favorite son in the recent Civil War with England, as well as his wife, who died of grief soon after, Harry has given up on love and instead sees hate as the way to keep the blood flowing through his veins.\n\"A man is measured by his enemies,\" he tells his seemingly doltish, stuttering son Gus (Cillian Murphy). Harry chooses as his enemy the most powerful man in the village, pub owner and store-keeper George (Adrian Dunbar), who also runs a matchmaking sideline, procuring young wives from out of town for a fee.\nWhen Gus takes a shine to George's new girl Eileen (Kerry Condon), Harry at first opposes the union, but soon sees it as a means to bring about George's downfall. When George -- an inveterate Romeo prone to taking advantage of his girls -- has his way with freshly married Eileen, Harry sets about trashing George's reputation by stirring the community's righteous anger.\nHowever, the villagers are as disturbed by Harry's accelerating madness as they are by George's philandering. Harry then maneuvers Gus to shoot George, and attempts to shame George by driving Eileen to suicide. But the scheme brings about the bitter dissolution of his own family, carving a destiny of desolation and solitude for Harry.\nWhile the roots of hatred and its destructive force represent themes all too tangibly linked to the recent reality of Paskaljevic's native Balkans, \"Harry\" is given the added mythical dimensions of a folktale in the script by the director, his wife, Christine Gentet, and Irish writer Stephen Walsh.\nElements of magic and dreams combine with some of the same lively spirit of tragicomic absurdism that made \"The Powder Keg\" a unique take on the Bosnian conflict. Also brought into play to great effect is the force of nature, through tree imagery from Harry's nightmare, and the elements, with rain and wind constantly battering the lonely setting. Lenser Milan Spasic's muted colors and shadowy tones lend further atmosphere to the rural landscapes.\nDirecting in English for the second time after the little-seen MGM produced 1982 feature \"Twilight Time\" (his 1995 \"Someone Else's America\" also was partly in English), Paskaljevic displays a sure command of his cast. Supporting players provide sturdy backup to Meaney's powerful centerpiece.\nDunbar makes George sly and superior but not unsympathetic, a \"whoremaster\" in Harry's words, but an affectionate rather than indifferent one. Both Gus and Eileen initially appear weak, their actions dictated by those around them, but Murphy and Condon gradually bristle to life as their characters summon the resolve to break away from Harry's insanity. The bond between the couple -- from their instant attraction and love to the tenderness they maintain for each other throughout the humiliating ordeal -- is beautifully conveyed.\nStefano Arnaldi's lovely score ranges from gentle Celtic themes to full-bodied orchestral pieces with choral elements.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.57752, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "How <em>Harry</em> Became a Tree", "sections": "How <em>Harry</em> Became a Tree", "body": "The most disparate elements are woven together into a surprisingly organic and satisfying whole in &quot;How <em>Harry</em> Became a Tree.&quot; Segueing from his critical breakthrough with 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Powder Keg&quot; to this assured English-language feature, Goran Paskaljevic has transposed a Chinese fable to 1920s"}, "id": "56a49323c75d075fd30006fb"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Wild About Harry", "Lisa Nesselson", "Latest", "U.K.", "Most Popular", "Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney Expected to Exit \u2018SNL\u2019", "Vomit, Poop and Woody Harrelson: \u2018Triangle of Sadness\u2019 Shocks Cannes With Uproarious Eight-Minute Standing Ovation", "Halsey Claims Label \u2018Won\u2019t Let Me\u2019 Release New Song \u2018Unless They Can Fake a Viral Moment on TikTok\u2019", "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u2019 Trailer Teases Tom Cruise\u2019s Biggest Stunts Ever", "How 'SNL' Said Goodbye to Kate McKinnon, Pete Davidson, Aidy Bryant, and Kyle Mooney", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him (EXCLUSIVE)", "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 4 Is the Show at Its Biggest, Broadest and Most Emblematic of Netflix\u2019s Evolution: TV Review", "John Mulaney Draws Criticism for Having Dave Chappelle Open, Tell \u2018Transphobic Jokes\u2019 at Ohio Show", "\u2018Moonage Daydream\u2019 Trailer Unveils Dazzling David Bowie Footage Ahead of Cannes Premiere", "Mick Jagger on Harry Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "Must Read", "Kendrick Lamar's 'Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers' Bows at No. 1 With Year\u2019s Biggest First-Week Debut", "\u2018Holy Spider\u2019 Review: A Taut, True-Crime Procedural Tangled in the Wicked Web of Iranian Patriarchy", "Roman Polanski Always Thrived in France, But Now Even His Adopted Country is Turning On Him", "Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve on Lea Seydoux Starrer 'One Fine Morning;' Clip Unveiled", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "It\u2019s Harry Styles\u2019 Turn to Say \u2018Good Night\u2019 in Cozy Bedtime Story Read Along", "George Shultz\u2019s Two-Penthouse San Francisco Home Hits the Market for $29 Million", "MLS Marketing Arm Extends Deal With Mexican National\u00a0Team", "10 Best Antibacterial Body Washes to Get Really Your Skin Clean", "All Rise Season 3 Trailer: Lola Finds Herself at War, Mark Has a Bombshell", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "Wild About Harry", "type": "Article", "post_id": 1200464613, "external_id": "9e7fcac5423d97434cd8251ecd5afebceac38db0", "content_type": "Article", "image": "", "url": "https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/wild-about-harry-2-1200464613/", "published_at": "2000-10-23T00:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-24T18:02:41Z", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Lisa Nesselson", "popularity": 1, "body": "In \"Wild About Harry,\" Brendan Gleeson and Amanda Donohoe give nicely shaded perfs as an about-to-divorce couple whose split is deferred when the husband emerges from a coma thinking he's still 18.

Excellent premise about being given a second chance hasn't been taken as far as it could, but there's a template here that could be remade in any language. As it stands, pic is perfect for international tube play and comedy fests.\rHarry McKee (Gleeson) is a drunkard and womanizer whose misbehavior has been on the cover of the Sunday tabloids for 15 years, due to his fame as a chat-show chef whose live weekday broadcast, \"What's Cooking?,\" has a devoted fan base. His wife, Ruth (Donohoe), and son have had it with his boorish approach.\rThe night before the couple head to divorce court, where Harry's lawyer (Adrian Dunbar) doesn't have a shred of mitigating testimony, Harry is badly beaten by young thugs. On his show the next morning, Harry's propriety filters are gone and he egregiously insults his guests, an MP (James Nesbitt) and his wife.\rJust as the judge is about to decree the divorce, Harry slumps to the courtroom floor unconscious and remains that way.

Pic, centering on an old pal who disrupts his former schoolmate's life, showcases remarkably witty writing and tremendous perfs from all four leads, most notably Sergi Lopez as charming psycho Harry. Moll masterfully weaves together Hitchcockian thriller elements and brainy comedy to create an original film that's never less than surprising. Powered by strong reviews, specialty item could travel in international arthouse circles but will necessi-tate careful handling in English-speaking territories.\nStrange tale opens with Michel (Laurent Lucas) and Claire (Mathilde Seigner) on the brink of losing it big time in a hot, cramped car with their three young daughters, Jeanne (Victoire de Koster), Sarah (Laurie Caminita) and Iris (Lorena Caminita). The scene is set for the vacation from hell, complete with complaining kids and exasperated parents. Then along comes Harry (Lopez).\nAt a roadside pit stop, Michel meets an odd fellow in the washroom; he doesn't recognize him at first, but, with much prompting from Harry, Michel realizes they were in high school together. It is a wonderful scene: With a blissed-out grin on his face, Harry stands there looking pleasant but somehow off-kilter as he talks to a surprised Michel.\nBy the time they hit the road again, Harry and his plump, attractive girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), have insinuated themselves into Michel and Claire's life. They follow them to the run-down farmhouse where the family holidays, and, before long, Harry is amusing Claire and disturbing Michel by reciting from memory a poem Michel wrote for the school paper 20 years earlier. By the time Harry spontaneously buys them a pricey jeep, Michel and Claire are beginning to pick up mighty weird vibes.\nFor Harry, who has lived an easy life thanks to his father's wealth, there are no problems, only solutions. If your car's broken down, you just buy a new one. If someone is interfering with you, well, you just get rid of them like an old car.\nBy the one-hour mark, Harry is off on a murderous rampage, and it's a testament to Moll's skill that he manages to maintain the right tone throughout. Once the blood starts flowing, it would be easy -- and not all that interesting -- for the pic to become either a sledgehammer satire or a routine thriller. But Moll segues effortlessly from the violent moments to scenes of morbid humor without missing a beat.\nOne of the main reasons \"Harry\" works so well is that the pic keeps the viewer on edge. Harry is a seriously charming psychopath, and it's easy to see why Michel is so taken with him initially.\nThere are many welcome shades to Michel's character as well. Unlike Claire, Michel is easily pushed around by people and events, even when Harry is stretching the limits of acceptable behavior. Moll has succeeded in crafting an unusual offering on a topic -- the everyday anxieties facing a young family on the verge of parental burnout -- that is all too familiar.\nLopez, excellent in last year's \"Une Liaison Pornographique,\" is spot-on as Harry. From the moment he appears onscreen, he captivates with his mix of affable magnetism and repressed fury and makes it immediately clear that something not quite right lurks beneath the rosy veneer. Lucas has the sullen but charismatic look more common to snooty British rock 'n' rollers than to thesps (in fact he looks like a refugee from the Verve or Oasis), and he is able to express a lot about his character without showcasing open emotions.\nSeigner is good as the harried and suspicious wife, while Guillemin, who was also terrific in last year's \"Ennui,\" once again crafts a character who's more sensual than smart but is anything but a bimbo.\nThe score from veteran composer David Sinclair Whitaker, who penned music for many classic British vampire pics, moves nicely from fluffy fare to increasingly sinister old-fashioned horror pic numbers. Good use is also made of a scratchy vintage version of \"Ramona,\" sung by Dolores del Rio, which pops up throughout pic.\nSuperior widescreen lensing pumps up eeriness to good effect via lots of images of spooky nighttime countryside vistas.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.566223, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em>, He&#x27;s Here to Help", "sections": "<em>Harry</em>, He\u2019s Here to Help", "body": "Helmer Dominik Moll gets it right in the very first scene of &quot;<em>Harry</em>, He&#x27;s Here to Help,&quot; perfectly capturing the mundane angst of family vacations, and this twisted black comedy rarely misses the mark for the next two hours.

From a recent RCA CD dedicated to the memory of Duke Ellington, Allen also illustrated the influence of tenor giant Ben Webster with the wonderfully rich and bold tone he adopted for \"Just Squeeze Me.\" He also recalled another Webster landmark performance with his own gutsy attack on \"Cottontail.\"\nOn Antonio Carlos Jobim's enveloping \"Corcovado\" (\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\"), Allen displayed the classic finesse of the legendary Zoot Sims by inserting a bright swinging phrase and following it with the lilting structural framework of the ballad. His phrasing is always rich, imaginative and surprising.\nAllen labeled \"I'll Only Miss Her When I Think of Her\" his favorite ballad, and invested the Jimmy Van Heusen torcher with rich emotional phrasing.

As Harry Connick Jr. continues his foray as a musical jack-of-all-trades, his mastery of New Orleans funk continues to be the one saving grace in his otherwise bland gumbo. His appropriately titled Funk Band is skilled and able; their 12-minute introductory instrumental a unique blend of '60s soul-jazz and spunky New Orleans rhythms set a high-water mark for the evening that was matched only when Connick and troops marched through Professor Longhair's Bayou standard \"Big Chief.\" Before he was even 21, Connick was seen as the link from New Orleans legends such as Longhair and James Booker to Thelonious Monk; a few singing lessons later, he was inheritor of the Sinatra/Darin crown. In both guises, Connick was a stellar showman and entertainer with a storytelling proficiency that few musical talents possess. In this more upbeat context, he utilizes his commanding stage presence his movie success is truly no fluke which has helped keep his shows lively. However, his recordings, such as this summer's \"Star Turtle,\" have turned leaden and uninvolving. The problem rests in the voice and, on occasion, song structure and lyrics. The best at this Southern funk game O.V. Wright, Wilson Pickett, R. Kelly, any Neville you choose possess a worldliness and a weariness that strike the soul. A mere 20 minutes into the show and Connick was singing with the dull inflection of Billy Joel or Kenny Loggins; when he performed an unrecorded modified rumba about voodoo, everything blended except the voice. Worse, particularly on the oddly disjointed \"Just Like Me,\" Connick's voice neither followed nor contrasted the musical textures tightly woven behind him. Dressed in tight white T-shirt and black jeans, Connick was showered by catcalls and female shrieks, suggesting his appeal does indeed rest in more than music. He did, however, show his pianistic prowess on a solo tour-de-force that started on \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" and blasted through a boatload of boogie-woogie and ragtime. He turned to the drums for Sly Stone's \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\" and trumpet for a funereal \"America\" (and again the voice kept it from swelling the sense of nationalistic pride that Ray Charles' version did so many years ago.) Connick's other covers, Dobie Gray's \"Drift Away\" and Burt Bacharach and Hal David's \"This Guy's in Love With You,\" which he has recorded for Fox's \"One Fine Day,\" were generally undistinguished.

And as far as these ears are concerned, he does a better job with the New Orleans R&B thing than anything else he's tried -- all things being relative.\n The proof is on Connick's new album, \"She\" (Columbia), where he throws out his jazz/pop act and immerses himself in the idiom of the Meters, that great, strutting New Orleans rhythm section.\n    Using some of the musicians from \"She,\" Connick put together a whomping touring band called Funky Dunky, which laid down a deep, menacing groove whenever asked.\n    With mostly vintage keyboards -- including two lovable antiques, the Hohner clavinet and Rhodes electric piano -- littering the front of the ramped stage, Connick must have been in wah-wah heaven.\n    As a composer, he came up with at least two gems: the album's romping, brass-driven single \"(I Could Only) Whisper Your Name,\" (a bit rushed at the Bowl), and a mean, spare vamp in the Meters' voodoo manner, \"Joe Slam and the Spaceship.\"\n    Yet Connick himself, engaging wiseguy persona and all, was the music's weakest link.

The real enthusiasm began when the \"old\" Connick showed up minus the band, pounding a long series of New Orleans standards on a rickety, revolving, studio upright piano that materialized out of nowhere.\n    For those who know the real stride stuff, it was excruciating, but they were clearly outnumbered.\n    Earlier in the evening, the Leroy Jones Quintet opened with a competent set of straight-ahead New Orleans jazz; later on, Jones and his trombonist added some snazzy brass ingredients to Connick's jambalaya.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.530031, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Connick Jr.", "body": "Though it may have come as a shock to his legions of swooning fans, <em>Harry</em> Connick Jr. went hip-deep into funk at the Hollywood Bowl, leaving the ersatz-Sinatra-cabaret stuff largely behind.

Big as a cinder block and nearly as heavy, the fourth novel in J.K. Rowling\u2019s bestselling YA series inspired fans to line up at bookstores around the country days in advance. At 734 pages, \u201cHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\u201d was a monster \u2014 the biggest book many young fans had ever contemplated reading. Getting through it took effort, albeit the kind that brought deep and immediate rewards to those bewitched by the parallel reality Rowling had invented, one where wizards existed alongside the rest of us unfortunate, non-magic folk.\r\n\r\nWell, here we are, three movies into Rowling\u2019s convoluted big-screen prequel saga, and the series once again feels like work, only this time, the resulting pleasures will strike audiences quite differently, depending on your level of dedication to the franchise. \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\u201d is rooted deep in the mythology of Rowling\u2019s Wizarding World, seldom slowing down long enough to explain the magic spells or strategies used by its characters. That\u2019ll no doubt vex casual viewers, keeping them at wand\u2019s length from the interpersonal relationships that make this grand fight for the planet worth watching. But devotees will likely adore the revelations in store, including a deeper commitment to the tragic love story between beloved Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) and the wizard determined to settle a score with Muggle-kind.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp is out, but his character, Gellert Grindelwald, has grown more powerful than ever. Now played by Mads Mikkelsen (without addressing the switch) in a more grounded, less cartoonishly menacing vein, Grindelwald is determined to instigate a world war at roughly the same time that a certain Nazi was elected chancellor of Germany. The rise-of-fascism parallels are as unmistakable as the inspiration for the character\u2019s new haircut, which has gone from stark white sea anemone to a greasy Hitler-style forelock.\r\n\r\nAfter doing so much to lend consistency and credibility to Rowling\u2019s vision over the course of four \"Harry Potter\" movies and one overwrought spinoff, director David Yates hit an unexpected low with the second installment, \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald,\u201d a busy, bewildering eyesore that seemed more interested in showcasing all kinds of CG trickery than in telling an elegant and engaging story. While \u201cThe Secrets of Dumbledore\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly embrace simplicity, the screenplay \u2014 no longer credited to Rowling alone, but co-written by stalwart \u201cHarry Potter\u201d adapter Steve Kloves \u2014 feels far more focused. Happily, the execution proves that much easier to follow.\r\n\r\nUnlike the \"Harry Potter\" movies, which put the fate of humankind in the hands of three boarding school-bound kids, the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d cycle deals primarily with adult wizards in the wider early-20th-century world. Early on, Yates took this opportunity to demonstrate what mature magic practitioners are capable of \u2014 their abilities surely ought to be spectacular, even if it was hard not to feel overwhelmed watching impossible things happen. As Rowling projected the full extent of her creativity on screen, however, she left little room for audiences to use their own imaginations, depriving us of the best thing about her books.\r\n\r\nWe got constantly shape-shifting characters and others who could step through walls or teleport across countries; explosions all but destroyed entire cities, while defensive techniques protected certain wizards from being injured. There was even a spell that mass-erased witnesses\u2019 minds, giving the filmmakers license to wreak whatever havoc they pleased, as misbehaving make-believe animals ran amok and a miserable \u2014 and incredibly dangerous \u2014 \u201corphan\u201d named Credence caused trouble every time he lost his temper. (He's played by Ezra Miller, an intense young actor whose off-screen antics could get him booted from the sequel, considering what happened to Deep.)\r\n\r\nLike a young Luke Skywalker, Credence found himself torn between the forces of good and evil while trying to research the mystery of his origins. The final twist of \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d concerned a baby bird that Credence had adopted, which abruptly transformed from a harmless-looking hatchling to a full-grown, flaming phoenix \u2014 a creature known to come to the aid of Dumbledore clan members in times of need. Three years later, \u201cThe Secrets of Dumbledore\u201d finally reveals the nature of Credence\u2019s connection to this family, causing his allegiance to waver between Grindelwald and Albus.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, those two competing leaders were once quite close. Gazing into the desire-reflecting Mirror of Erised in the last film, Dumbledore described himself and Grindelwald as being \u201cmore than brothers,\u201d and flashed back to a memory of them forming a blood pact years earlier. Because of this connection \u2014 not unlike the one a violent attack will forge between Harry and Voldemort \u2014 neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald can so much as think of hurting the other without jeopardizing his own life. Time and again, usually for the best, love overrides reason in these films.\r\n\r\nAn enchanted pact-protecting pendant complicates the showdown anyone can see coming. In order to stop Grindelwald\u2019s power grab, Dumbledore will have to rely on proxies \u2014 namely, Newt Scamander, the endearingly awkward magizoologist embodied by Eddie Redmayne in the first two \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies. Grindelwald is similarly blocked but has an advantage, using a rare and highly revered dragon-deer creature called a qilin to see the future. (The character\u2019s brutal treatment of this noble and seemingly defenseless species is incredibly difficult to watch, even if the animal doesn\u2019t actually exist.)\r\n\r\nProphecies are nothing new to Rowling\u2019s storytelling, though here we get the added wrinkle that Grindelwald sees only snatches of what\u2019s to come, and can therefore be outwitted by \u201ccountersight\u201d \u2014 a tactic of doing deliberately misleading things to confuse him while keeping actual intentions secret until the last moment. This is an amusing if preposterous plan, and one that nevertheless earns points for originality.\r\n\r\nThree-fifths of the way through this series, ugly, ungainly enchantment overload is clearly the agreed-upon aesthetic, as Rowling and Kloves again come up with a plot that\u2019s considerably more complicated than it needs to be. Take the task entrusted to Newt\u2019s lovelorn assistant, Bunty Broadacre (Victoria Yeates), who commissions half a dozen identical copies of her boss\u2019s leather case, so as to disguise which one contains the qilin during the climactic scene. It\u2019s not likely that this scheme would fool someone who can see the future. In fact, if anyone\u2019s confused by the elaborately choreographed ruse, it is us, the audience.\r\n\r\nThat seems to be the key strategy of the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movies \u2014 which, incidentally, also serves what passes for magic in the real world: Distract the audience, so they don\u2019t see the trick and are therefore fooled into believing things as they are presented. Somewhere along the way, however, this franchise stopped being fun. If the eight \"Harry Potter\" films left us wanting to enroll in that same school, the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d series makes everything seem oppressive and unpleasant, teetering on the brink of a second Second World War \u2014 one that will presumably be narrowly avoided in the coming films, and which the non-magical sphere stands little chance of winning if Grindelwald ever gets his way.\r\n\r\nStill, there\u2019s something to be said for the way Rowling\u2019s vision spans multiple movies, how each installment feels like binge-watching the latest season of a prestige HBO series (an adult-friendly, PG-13 alternative to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d). No other film series works in such intricate multiple-installment arcs, planting details that will almost certainly pay off in forthcoming chapters. Building on what Peter Jackson did with the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, Rowling and Warner Bros. radically expanded the way cinema could be used to tell serialized stories, and with \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d they continue to innovate, potentially excluding all but the most faithful, rather than actively trying to convert newcomers to what, like \u201cStar Wars,\u201d has an almost religious hold on its followers.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 26.220903, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Potter", "body": "Remember way back in the year 2000, before even the first &quot;<em>Harry</em> Potter&quot; movie had been released?

Fable-like in its simplicity, though sometimes pretentiously so, \"Why Get Married the Day the World Ends\" shrouds elemental girl-chased-by-maniac thrills in thick B&W atmospherics and cloudy-at-best character motivations. While pic occasionally teeters on the edge of arty pulp, on a purely visceral level it works -- these terse 71 minutes are as harrowing as they are mysterious. Solid fest item could attract offshore interest from enterprising arthouse distribbers.\nEstablishing a nightmarish, morbid atmosphere right away, Cleven opens with an overhead shot of Juliette (Elina Lowensohn) laying blinklessly on the pavement amid discarded long-stem roses. Pic then backtracks to show how she got there, having run headlong into traffic to escape apparent longtime stalker Guido (Pascal Greggory). Initial appearances to the contrary, she's not dead or comatose, just in shock.\nGuido temporarily retreats as frazzled ambulance driver Gaspard (Jean-Henri Compere) drives the young woman off to the hospital. Once alert, however, she panics again, insisting her tormentor will soon find her -- as indeed he does, screaming through the sickroom door as Gaspard holds him at bay.\nSympathetic and already half-smitten, Gaspard commandeers the ambulance to drive Juliette home, unaware that Guido still shadows them both. After another narrow escape, protags flee to the countryside. Couple enjoys a night's romantic idyll before single-minded psychopath Guido turns up yet again, triggering hectic final series of chases and violent confrontations.\nLenser C.L. Zvonock's imaginative B&W imagery, alternately formal and frenzied, does much to create a nightmare-cum-fairy tale mood primal enough to require no explicit psychological explanations. (Late disclosure of long-ago child abuse comes off as banal and unnecessary.)\nAt moments pic does grow too fussily mannered, its mythic pretensions often radiating from the glam waif-victim halo around ethereal Juliette (though Lowensohn does as well by her role as possible). Fleeting directorial excess aside, however, \"Why Get Married\" admirably balances expressionistic dislocation, mordant humor and the no-exit intensity of more conventional thriller models such as \"The Hitcher\" and \"Wait Until Dark.\"\nGreggory limns an alarmingly vivid force of irrational mayhem, while Compere's somewhat sad-sack hero offers vulnerable, all-too-human contrast.\nDigitally vid-projected at San Jose Fest, feature is reportedly available in 35mm; it will look better in that format, as well as on the small screen.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 25.966312, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"body": "Enigmatic from its title on down, Belgian actor-turned-helmer <em>Harry</em> <em>Cleven</em>&#x27;s second fiction feature (following 1992&#x27;s &quot;Abracadabra&quot;) positions style over substance to mostly gripping effect.

Its liminal nature \u2014 blurring conceptions of life and death, self and other \u2014 is what makes it so endlessly fascinating to filmmakers and actors alike, calling on a rich range of transitory emotions, though things can easily tip into glib, sudsy melodrama if written and played with too heavy a hand. British writer-director Harry Macqueen pitches it just right in his delicately heart-crushing sophomore feature \"Supernova,\" thanks in no small part to the ideally matched star duo of Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci: As a longtime couple figuring out how to live \u2014 or not \u2014 under dementia's ever-encroaching shadow, their joint thespian grace and reserve take on an undertow of raging, disorganized despair.\r\n\r\nWorld-premiering in competition at San Sebasti\u00e1n \u2014 a major coup for the Spanish fest, which tends to lose dibs on starry English-language titles to Venice and Toronto \u2014 \"Supernova\" is beguilingly modest by design: essentially a two-man chamber piece twisted into the winding form of a British road movie, where nothing can move too fast, lest we reach the shore too soon. It's a virtual blockbuster, however, relative to actor-turned-filmmaker Macqueen's shoestring 2014 debut \"Hinterland,\" the airy promise of which his follow-up confirms, and then some. Despite the film's solemn smallness of scale, its leads \u2014 both in terrific form, with Firth in particular demonstrating new cracks and quivers in his stiff-upper-lip persona \u2014 should draw mature audiences in healthy numbers beyond the festival circuit. (Presumably with BAFTA season in mind, U.K. distributor Studiocanal currently has \"Supernova\" scheduled for a Nov. 27 release.)\r\n\r\nAs it follows sixtysomething partners Sam (Firth) and Tusker (Tucci) in a cluttered camper van through the north of England, on what looks to be their last vacation before Tusker's health severely deteriorates, Macqueen's talky original screenplay promises no surprises: There's only one way their journey can go, and the film resolves to follow it as intimately as possible. \"We're not going back, you know,\" Sam says to Tusker in the film's very first line of dialogue \u2014 and while he means it in a banal domestic sense, as a last call for any forgotten items before they hit the open road, they and we can hear the searching, melancholic subtext of those words.\r\n\r\nFor Tusker, as it turns out, has quite deliberately left something behind: the medication that's at least supposed to stall his mental decline, and that he's long decided had no effect anyway. A celebrated novelist now struggling to put pen to paper, Tusker has made quiet, stoic peace with his fate, independently tying up what loose ends of his life he can in the uncertain amount of time he has left. Sam, a classical pianist who has recently put his career aside to care for Tusker, can't approach things quite so pragmatically, as he clings to fast-fading delusions that their companionship will see them through the worst. Whether he's unable to accept grimly imminent reality more out of defiant love for his life partner of several decades, or his own cavernous terror of being left alone, is a question that \"Supernova\" addresses with moving frankness, even when its characters talk gingerly around the issue.\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, not much happens in \"Supernova,\" as Sam and Tusker chat, cuddle, argue, say a few goodbyes and take in all the ravishingly autumnal Lake District scenery they can get \u2014 though Mike Leigh's regular cinematographer Dick Pope finds as many planes of beauty in the couple's duskily lit indoor embraces as in those rolling green-to-ochre landscapes. The drama \u2014 and it proves lacerating, in its softly-softly way \u2014 comes as the two must gradually drop their tacitly agreed defences of denial and delay, and speak bluntly about what's best for them individually, landing on quite different answers along the way. This is not a crisis on which any kind of compromise can be reached: Someone has to win, and though \"Supernova\" doesn't see the struggle out to its bitterest end, its discreet, elliptical conclusion is sufficiently devastating in what it implies for the couple's future.\r\n\r\nFirth and Tucci are such reliable stalwarts that we tend not to regard their presence too closely in films these days: Almost invariably, they fulfill our expectations of their refined gravitas. But there's something lovely and surprising in what they bring out of each other here, as they complement and reflect each other's curtness, evasiveness and occasional spillages of tenderness in the way that long-term couples do. Old jokes and teases are recycled between them with loving half-heartedness, beautifully observed in Macqueen's writing: \"It isn't even satisfying half the time,\" Tusker admits, only to admit with a smirk, when asked why he still bothers, \"Because of the other half.\"\r\n\r\nPlaying the partner left behind by dementia can be a thankless task in this subgenre. Witness the comparative lack of awards recognition for the co-stars of Julie Christie in \"Away From Her,\" Emmanuelle Riva in \"Amour\" or Julianne Moore in \"Still Alice\" \u2014 though perhaps we're also looking at a relative scarcity of male protagonists put in the more vulnerable position, a prevailing dynamic that \"Supernova\" challenges with its thoughtful, unassuming depiction of an everyday gay relationship.\r\n\r\nBut it's Firth's Sam who finally carries the film's heart, and exquisitely so, as his fear, anger and mounting insecurity lash out the more he tries to remain undemonstrative.

However, this accessible, entertaining work may rep his most commercial in years. An amiably goofy yarn about a man so in love with the literal woman of his dreams he seeks help to sleep more effectively, pic feels more like a mainstream Czech comedy than the helmer's usual darker fare. Purists may grumble that Svankmajer's dumbed down, but more generous souls will be happy to see him still surviving and evolving at age 76.\nIn an unnamed contempo Czech city, middle-aged desk jockey Evzen (Vaclav Helsus) dreams of a beautiful younger woman (Klara Issova), who introduces herself as Eva and flirts with him in the streets, while bizarre dream people (naked women with chicken heads and vice versa, a creepy old woman played by Emilia Dosekova) bustle around them. When Evzen wakes up, he longs to go back to sleep and re-enter the dream, but keeps his desires a secret from his wife, Milada (Zuzanna Kronerova). His doctor (Frantisek Polata) advises that Evzen needs a shrink, not sleeping aids.\nWatched over by animated portraits of Freud and Jung who occasionally scrap with each other, Evzen goes into therapy with femme Dr. Holubova (Daniela Bakerova) who starts digging into his traumatic childhood memories. Meanwhile, in the dream world, the object of Evzen's affection insists she has a different name -- first Eliza, then Emily, and so on -- every time he meets her. Their affair progresses, but interruptions from her young son Petr (Jakub Frydrych), her ex-husband Milan (also played by Helsus, with a toupee), and the aforementioned creepy crone keep running interference.\nRoughly 40% of what's onscreen consists of closeup live-action footage of actors acting, with the rest animated. Although writer-helmer-production designer Svankmajer utilizes a bit of his trademark stop-motion technique to create oneiric, characteristically fleshy images of disembodied tongues wrestling and the like, the bulk of the animation here consists of 2D photographic cutouts. For Anglophone auds especially, the effect is highly reminiscent of the work Terry Gilliam did back in the 1960s for \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" with a dash of German Expressionist Max Ernst, which is no bad thing really. \nFor all the grotesquerie on display (and there's hardly anything here as disturbing as Svankmajer's imagery in 1988's \"Alice\"), pic feels much lighter in tone than the helmer's last few films, such as \"Lunacy,\" \"Little Otik\" or \"Conspirators of Pleasure.\" Take away some of the wackier flights of fancy, and this could almost pass for a film by, say, Jan Hrebejk in a whimsical mood.\nEnsemble's generally broad but well-timed thesping enhances the pic's playfully aimless atmosphere, with Helsus and Issova demonstrating believable chemistry as the central-May/late-October romantic leads. Tech credits are sturdy, with inventive surround sound design a standout.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 25.122326, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "Kimberley D. <em>Harris</em>"}, "id": "562bf9bc0711e82c5800036b"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Film Review: \u2018Only You\u2019", "Guy Lodge", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Reviewed at Curzon Soho, London, Oct. 16, 2018.

Others work because we fall so hard for the central couple ourselves that we'll root for them through any number of contrivances. It might do writer-director Harry Wootliff a disservice to call her mature, thoughtfully conceived debut feature \"Only You\" one of the latter, but the tinderbox connection between stars Laia Costa and Josh O'Connor is what elevates this grown-up relationship study from respectable to lovable: As unlikely lovers in perennially autumnal Glasgow whose fast, initially carefree bond is tested by fertility problems, .\n\nBuilding on their breakout turns in \"God's Own Country\" and \"Victoria,\" respectively, rising stars O'Connor and Costa represent the most internationally marketable element of this classy British production, which exudes a lot more upscale polish than its tiny budget might suggest \u2014 thanks in large part to Shabier Kirchner's burnished, cashmere-plush lensing. (Catalan actress Costa also comes direct from Dan Fogelman's \"Life Itself,\" a tear-jerker of significantly more expensive, more overwrought, more American proportions; Wootliff's film aces any comparison between them.) Production company The Bureau has had its greatest successes thus far with Andrew Haigh's brand of intimate domestic drama; given the right multi-platform push by U.K. distributors Curzon Artificial Eye, \"Only You\" could cultivate a younger version of the arthouse audience that saw itself in \"45 Years.\" Abroad, this recent London fest premiere will slot easily into further festival programs.\n\nProceedings begin with a tidy meet-cute on New Year's Eve, as Elena (Costa), a Spanish arts council worker, and Jake (O'Connor), a Ph.D student and moonlighting DJ, clash over one of the few available taxis roaming Glasgow's streets in the wee hours \u2014 though as their awkwardly shared ride is halted for Elena to throw up on the sidewalk, it's clear that \"Only You\" is a romance still rooted in less pleasant realities. Wootliff, along with editor Tim Fulford, is pleasingly brisk with the narrative formalities, as we cut to the pair drunkenly making out to Elvis Costello in her shabby-chic apartment. Jake and Elena move pretty quickly themselves: in a matter of weeks, a one-night stand becomes a co-habiting relationship.\n\nIndeed, they're shacked up before Elena reveals to Jake that the age gap between them is greater than he presumed: She's 35 years old to his 26. While sensitive, non-patriarchal Jake has no reservations about dating an older woman, the ticking of her biological clock is tacitly audible to them both. As swiftly and spontaneously as they got together, the couple jointly decides to try for a baby \u2014 yet while they have all the chemistry in the world going for them,\u00a0biology is not on their side. As the couple embarks on the slow, stressful, and far-from-certain route of IVF treatment, it begins to seem that mutual adoration may not be enough to keep them together. If, from this point, \"Only You's\" storytelling stalls and circles a bit, that's largely the point in a film that asks how long a relationship can subsist on shared hope before recurring disappointment turns it toxic. (That the word \"adoption\" never once surfaces in proceedings is a surprising blank space in Wootliff's otherwise well-shaded, emotionally credible script.)\n\nThe age difference between Jake and Elena is an unconventional dynamic \u2014 all the more so in the realm of cinema \u2014 that \"Only You\" explores with wit and candor, as well as a breezy matter-of-factness that doesn't condescend to either character. (After all, far greater gaps between older men and younger women pass without comment in mainstream romantic dramas all the time.) Neither is their relationship idealized at the expense of showing its tenuous, ill-informed fault lines: It runs first and foremost on sheer desire, and O'Connor and Costa play it so warmly and unaffectedly that we're as inclined as they are to overlook the cracks. As Jake, O'Connor balances easy charm with a volatile streak of impetuosity that runs hot and cold according to the situation; Costa has the more grueling job as matters progress, and is quite wrenching as the mounting physical and psychological exhaustion of their quest to conceive takes its toll on her.\n\nSo closely and exactingly drawn is their relationship that secondary details of their lives and environment seem a bit vague by comparison. There's limited explanation of how a Spaniard and a middle-class Englishman both came to settle in Scotland, while their surrounding circle of friends and colleagues wants for plausible detail and diversity. Whatever the circumstances that brought them there, however, Glasgow makes for a pretty dreamy backdrop to headlong infatuation and lingering heartache alike. Rarely afforded its due on screen, Scotland's big port city gets a toasty glow-up under Kirchner's lens, emerging as a city to fall in love to, with and in \u2014 not the only way in which \"Only You\" bridges realism and romanticism to stirring effect.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 25.104715, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Wootliff", "body": "Some movie romances work as a result of artfully wrought drama and sparkling human observation.

It didn\u2019t matter that no one could hear the exact words \u2014 older brother William was clearly calming wedding jitters.\r\nMarkle was a vision in an exquisitely cut and minimalist gown by\u00a0Givenchy's creative director Clare Waight Keller\u00a0with a very long train. The prince\u2019s expression changed from worry to joy as she neared.\r\nHer mother, Doria Loyce Ragland, fought tears. Yes, her daughter was marrying into the royal family and in a fairytale setting, but she sat alone -- the bride\u2019s only blood relative among 600 guests.\u00a0Her father made some missteps last week by posing for tabloids, but then quickly bowed out of the event citing health problems.\r\nAnd what a wedding. It was a perfect blending of centuries of tradition that guides the British monarchy with the new world of a scrappy actress, the biracial, divorced daughter of a yoga teacher and lighting director. \r\nThe new couple stamped their own personal style on it.\r\nEarly in the ceremony, Harry, as his wont, drew laughter, when he said, \u201cI will.\u201d Markle beamed after she said, \u201cI will.\u201d \r\nThe Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, the 27th Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, gave the address, likely one that had never been heard inside these hallowed halls. \r\nThe Episcopal Church\u2019s first African-American leader and a passionate speaker, Curry quoted Dr. Martin Luther King: \u201cWe must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love, and when we do that we will make of this whole world a new world of love. Love is the only way. There is power in love.\u201d\r\n\u201cTwo young people fell in love and we all showed up,\u201d Curry said.\r\nCurry also brought up slaves in America and how the power of love is a balm no matter how awful the situation. His rousing sermon had the couple listening intently. He did try to get some audience participation, but this crowd seemed less interactive than those he may usually preach to.\r\nAfter songs, including \u201cStand by Me\u201d during which the bride and groom shared a few smiles, they took their vows and Markle placed a ring on Harry\u2019s finger. This, too, is another indication of how the couple put their own stamp on the ceremony: He is the first male royal to wear a wedding band. Wedding rings were not popular among men in the U.K. before World War II.\r\nAs guests were signing the registry, a cellist who shot to fame on \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d Sheku Kaneh-Mason, played. Only 19, he won the BBC Young Musician of the Year award in 2016, and was the first person of color to win the honor.\r\nThe couple left the church, shared their first kiss before the public, and managed to get into the open horse-drawn carriage flawlessly as crowds cheered and Princess Charlotte waved from the steps.\r\nThe Duchess of Sussex has perfected her own wave as well. As stuffy as the British royal family can be, there was still more of laidback feeling to this wedding than others that have drawn such worldwide attention.\r\nThe dress itself was telling. Not just that in its exquisite simplicity and expected princess glamour, but that it was a tightly kept secret, even among Markle's close cadre of friends. Honoring that secret, inviting so many people instrumental in their charities, ensuring representation of people of color in the ceremony, and how Markle chose to walk down the aisle are all clear indications of who this very modern royal couple is.\r\nThe essence of composure, Markle walked herself part of the way down aisle then met up with her now father-in-law, Prince Charles, who escorted her the rest of the way. He purposefully did not give her away.\u00a0\r\nEven with a staff dedicated to preparing this wedding, Markle did not lose sight of whose wedding it truly is.\u00a0When she and her mother did a final check of the church Friday, she found the floral arrangements wanting and asked for more foliage.\u00a0The chapel was festooned with locally sourced beech and birch branches, lilies of the valley and foxgloves. Princess Diana\u2019s favorite white roses and Markle\u2019s favorite peonies were the most prominent flowers. Philippa Craddock, a London florist, supplied the arrangements.\r\nRequesting the floral tweak might not strike most as a big deal, but it reveals two striking elements: Markle asserted her authority and she knew how it would play on camera.\r\nGuests adhered to the invitation\u2019s dress code. Women topped day dresses with hats, from jaunty fascinators to elaborate wide-brimmed hats, decorated with peacock feathers, ribbons and tulle. \r\nMost of the dresses were conservative in a rainbow of colors and floral patterns. Men, for the most part, stuck to traditional morning coats, the black cutaway with tails, a vest and gray slacks, though some men, notably George Clooney, opted for a pearl gray suit. \r\nHis wife, Amal, wore a deep yellow dress with a stunning saucer hat trimmed with a veil.

(Leonard Cohen\u2019s final album, \u201cYou Want It Darker,\u201d probably counts, to register a comparison we shouldn't stretch too thin.) \u201cSmalls Change (Meditations Upon Ageing),\u201d though, might be the first long player devoted primarily to the physical indignities that come toward the end of the long game \u2014 dental, arthritic, follicular and erectile dysfunctions all included. It\u2019s a heavy metal borscht belt album, full of \u201cTake my gall bladder, please\u201d humor updated for rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019s own sunset years, with the added pleasure of the world\u2019s screaming-est guitarists to go with the screaming gout. \u00a0\r\nSpeaking of impending death, Spinal Tap appears to have finally bought the sex farm. Some time after their last reunion tour in 2009, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest apparently decided 40 years was enough flogging for what began as a one-off TV sketch in 1979. It\u2019s natural that Harry Shearer would be the one carrying the burden of mock-rock forward and asking, \u201cHow could I leave this behind?,\u201d since he\u2019s stayed in satirical songwriting practice, still writing \u00a0songs on a weekly basis for his public radio program, \u201cLe Show.\u201d In this album\u2019s ludicrously majestic title track, Shearer/Smalls offers a simple enough explanation for soldiering on alone to the mediocre end: \u201cLukewarm water, it still has to flow,\u201d he sings, echoing a memorable deadpan line from the \u201984 movie. \u201cSomewhere to be, and somewhere to go.\u201d\r\nBreakup ballads aside, the album mostly sticks to the practical problems of the age 70-plus rocker, 55 years on from everybody hoping they died before \u2026 this happened: \u201cBreath getting short / Life getting long / You\u2019re hanging on / By a thread and a thong,\u201d Smalls sings in \u201cRock and Roll Transplant.\u201d (Did Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cTime\u201d say it any better?) \u201cNow, rocking out is just another chore\u201d encapsulates what stadium-goers everywhere suspect Mick is thinking and hope he\u2019s not... Mick Mars, that is, since we couldn't possibly think of comparing Spinal Tap to the Stones.\r\n \u201cHell Toupee,\u201d possibly hair metal\u2019s first male pattern baldness anthem, addresses Satan\u2019s own pate (\u201cHis realm could still be hellish if he had a mop to flop / You\u2019ll still rue the day you met him with some coverage on top\u201d). In the album\u2019s most boldly crude number, \u201cGummin\u2019 the Gash,\u201d a lack of dentures is presented as, well, no barrier to advanced sexual technique (\u201cThis beast don\u2019t need no fangs\u201d). The best track, \u201cMRI\u201d (\u201cYou don\u2019t get high from the barium dye\u201d), has Smalls and guest guitarist Dweezil Zappa adopting speed metal in service of the subject that is literally least appropriate for headbanging.\u00a0\r\nOn an hour-long album where there\u2019s a new punch line every rhyme, some land and many don\u2019t. Occasionally the title beats the tune; Shearer could have dropped the mic after coming up with \u201cShe Puts the Bitch in Obituary.\u201d \u201cButt Call\u201d doesn\u2019t find any new laughs in the topic of accidental big-bottom dialing, although the chorus\u2019s percussive combination of frantic drumming by Foo Fighter Taylor Hawkins and an iPhone on vibration mode is inexplicably awesome.\u00a0\r\nBig-name instrumental guests help the comedy go down easier, since the guttural voice Shearer adopted for Smalls back in the \u201980s was never meant to fuel an entire album. If you have a soft spot for hard rock shredding but can\u2019t appreciate its pompous contexts unironically, this is the album for you, with Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Steve Lukather present and taking their eruptive tasks very seriously. A more eclectic guitar hero, Richard Thompson, even pops up to do the metal solo we always suspected he could. Prog keyboard king Rick Wakeman duels with Satriani on a nine-minute pomp-rock finale, and Shearer spends some of that \u201cSimpsons\u201d cash on a few tracks' worth of elaborate symphonic orchestration that\u2019s as melodious as he isn\u2019t.\u00a0\r\nThe biggest treat is a classic-era Steely Dan semi-reunion, with Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter and Larry Carlton adding their signature licks to \u201cMemo to Willie,\u201d which reveals its crucial fetish via jazzy chord changes, horn charts and a sly guitar quotation from \u201cReelin\u2019 in the Years\u201d even before Donald Fagen stops by to sing the ED-defying refrain: \u201cWillie, don\u2019t lose that lumber.\u201d\u00a0(Steely Dan did take their name from a literary phallus, so maybe Fagen is repaying some kind of karmic debt, participating in this virility upkeep gag.)\r\nBut as with the original movie, there\u2019s a hint of poignancy underneath (OK, way underneath) a song like \u201cWhen Men Did Rock,\u201d which eulogizes a form of music slowly slipping off this mortal coil along with its practitioners. Age makes fools even of those of us who weren\u2019t warming up puppet shows 35 years ago, so who are we to cast stones at sad senior rock gods like Smalls, who only wants his career to go to age 111? \u201cSmalls Change\u201d might be the hokiest album of 2018, and also maybe the most honest.\r\n\r\nDerek Smalls\r\n\"Smalls Change\"\r\nTwanky/BMG Records\r\nProducers: CJ Vanston and Harry Shearer\r\nGuest musicians:\u00a0Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter,\u00a0Gregg Bissonette,\u00a0Larry Carlton,\u00a0David Crosby,\u00a0Donald Fagen,\u00a0Taylor Hawkins,\u00a0Jim Keltner,\u00a0Danny (Kootch) Kortchmar,\u00a0Russ Kunkel,\u00a0Michael League,\u00a0Jane Lynch,\u00a0Steve Lukather,\u00a0Judith Owen,\u00a0Snarky Puppy Horns,\u00a0Joe Satriani,\u00a0Paul Shaffer,\u00a0Chad Smith,\u00a0Richard Thompson,\u00a0Steve Vai,\u00a0Waddy Wachtel,\u00a0Rick Wakeman,\u00a0Phil X,\u00a0Dweezil Zappa", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.995426, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Shearer", "body": " decided 40 years was enough flogging for what began as a one-off TV sketch in 1979.

AFI Fest audience award winner will knock 'em dead in vid and specialty cable.\rLike many showbiz upstarts in the early 20th century, Castle changed his name from a more ethnic origin (his German family name, Schloss, literally translates as \"castle\"), learned a lot from the stage (gimmicks with a stage version of \"Dracula\" turned a B.O. trick) and had a glancing connection with Orson Welles.\rSchwartz draws a thoughtful comparison between Castle's key Hollywood mentor, Columbia's notorious Harry Cohn, and Castle himself, who developed a reputation in Hollywood as a genuinely nice family man (Castle's daughter, Terry, backs this up on camera.) The business doesn't turn everyone into a monster, and Castle appeared to be living proof, instead channeling his demons into a string of B-horror programmers concocted in the late '50s, when he had had enough of working for the studios.\r\"Spine Tingler!\" is most fun describing the key Castle movies -- \"Macabre,\" the rather dull \"The House on Haunted Hill,\" the amusingly silly \"The Tingler\" (his second venture with Vincent Price), \"13 Ghosts\" -- and fans-turned-moviemakers like John Waters and Joe Dante, who enjoy recalling the cheesy, giddy effect the pics had on auds. (References to and/or clips from Dante's own terrific feature tribute to Castle, \"Matinee,\" are inexplicably AWOL.)\rCastle's homegrown genius lay in knowing that the movies weren't enough, but had to have something extra to lure crowds. For \"Macabre,\" it was a Lloyd's of London insurance policy against death by fright; then it was 3-D effects like \"Emergo\" (fake skeletons in the cinema), \"Illusion-O\" (quasi-3-D glasses able to \"view\" ghosts onscreen) and \"Percepto\" (theater seats rigged with vibrating buzzers).\rPic perhaps makes too much of President Kennedy's assassination and '60s cultural tumult as causes for Castle's decline; more likely it was the technical advances in genre moviemaking, which made many of his pics look fairly cheap. His long-delayed leap into A movies, as producer of \"Rosemary's Baby\" (which he originally wished to direct himself), proved a short-lived, if lucrative, victory, and doc finally slows down long enough to take measure of Castle's frustrating final years in the '70s.\rOverly bright and uneven look (resulting from no fewer than 11 credited cameramen) indicates a work best suited to DVD viewing, where at least viewers feeling too rushed by Schwartz and Philip Harrison's hyper editing can hit the pause button.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.430054, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"sections": "\u2018This Is Spinal Tap\u2019 Sequel in the Works With Rob Reiner, Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, <em>Harry</em> Shearer", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Cohn", "body": " name, Schloss, literally translates as &quot;castle&quot;), learned a lot from the stage (gimmicks with a stage version of &quot;Dracula&quot; turned a B.O. trick) and had a glancing connection with Orson Welles.\rSchwartz draws a thoughtful comparison between Castle&#x27;s key Hollywood mentor, Columbia&#x27;s notorious <em>Harry</em> Cohn"}, "id": "562ba877c75d0709ff000192"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "Todd McCarthy", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "Anna Delvey Unveils Surreal NYC Art Show of Sketches Drawn in Prison: \u2018My Narrative From My Perspective\u2019", "\u2018Daredevil\u2019 Disney+ Series in the Works With Matt Corman, Chris Ord Set to Write (EXCLUSIVE)", "Stephanie McMahon Announces \u2018Leave of Absence\u2019 From WWE", "'Top Gun: Maverick' Gets Rapturous Five-Minute Standing Ovation at Cannes, Crowd Raves for Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer", "Anne Hathaway, James Gray Tear Up During Seven-Minute Emotional Cannes Standing Ovation for \u2018Armageddon Time\u2019", "Faith Hill Says Filming Sexy '1883' Bathtub Scene With Tim McGraw 'Was Tough'", "Harry Styles Moves Smoothly Into His Next Era With the Intimate \u2018Harry\u2019s House\u2019: Album Review", "'The Masked Singer' Finale Reveals Identities of Firefly, Ringmaster and Prince: Here\u2019s Who Won Season 7", "'Heartstopper' Renewed for Two More Seasons at Netflix", "\u2018Armageddon Time\u2019 Review: James Gray\u2019s Deft 1980 Coming-of-Age Memoir Is an Old-School Liberal Message Movie in Progressive Drag", "Must Read", "\u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2019 Gets Rapturous Five-Minute Standing Ovation at Cannes", "Los Angeles Arthouses Face Uphill Battle After Latest High-Profile Closing", "Johnny Depp Repeatedly Hit Amber Heard in the Face, Her Sister Testifies", "Chris Wallace Will Lead New Show in CNN Sunday Block", "Hollywood's Iconic TCL Chinese Theatre Celebrates 95 Years of Premieres and Stars", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "Mike Campbell and Stan Lynch on Their Surprise Heartbreakers Reunion", "Boat of the Week: Inside \u2018Secret,\u2019 the Lavish 271-Foot Superyacht Owned by Walmart Heiress Nancy Walton Laurie", "Oklahoma\u2019s ESPN+ Deal Reflects New Thinking About\u00a0Distribution", "The 16 Best Ellipticals for Low-Impact Cardio Workouts at Home", "Mrs. Maisel: Milo Ventimiglia's 'Handsome Man' Returning In Final Season For 'More Extensive' Encore", "Variety", "Legal", "Variety Magazine", "VIP+ Account", "Connect", "Alerts and Newsletters", "Follow Us", "Verify it's you", "Please log in"], "title": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "type": "Article", "tags": ["CoSA", "Craig Brewster", "David Yates", "Fiona Weir", "Half", "Harry Potter", "Harry Potter And The Half-blood Prince", "Harrypotter And The Half Blood Prince", "James Mather", "James Mathers", "JK Rowling", "John Richardson", "Luma Pictures", "Michael Warwick", "Nick Dudman", "Plain Jane", "Prince", "Rising Sun Pictures", "Steve Kloves", "Stuart Craig", "Tim Burke", "Tom Felton", "Warwick Davis"], "post_id": 1200506934, "external_id": "bb938352604e7090492ee0fc5bd25e97433ee0c8", "content_type": "Article", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/who_endless_wire.jpg?w=125", "url": "https://variety.com/2009/film/features/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-1200506934/", "published_at": "2009-07-05T12:44:32Z", "updated_at": "2018-06-15T17:57:32Z", "topics": ["Features", "Markets & Festivals", "Reviews"], "appeared_in_print": "No", "comment_count": 0, "author": "Todd McCarthy", "popularity": 1, "body": "Kids' stuff is a thing of the past in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\" Suddenly looking quite grown up, the students at Hogwarts are forced to grapple with heavy issues of mortality, memory and loss in this sixth installment in the series of bigscreen adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Potter tales. Dazzlingly well made and perhaps deliberately less fanciful than the previous entries, this one is played in a mode closer to palpable life-or-death drama than any of the others and is quite effective as such. Delayed by Warner Bros. from a late 2008 release date so as to spread the wealth after \"The Dark Knight\" scored so mightily last summer, this \"Prince\" is poised to follow its predecessors as one of the year's two or three top-earning films.\rAfter sitting out \"The Order of the Phoenix,\" screenwriter Steve Kloves happily returned to once again skillfully condense a massive book into manageable dramatic form; among many tough narrative decisions, he has cut back on the violent mayhem surrounding the murderous climax and put off the introduction of Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour until the next episode. \rDirector David Yates, after a prosaic series debut on the prior film, displays noticeably increased confidence here, injecting more real-world grit into what began eight years ago as purest child's fantasy; messenger owls and chattering house elves have been superseded by a frank Underground tea-room flirtation, school security checks and raging teenage hormones. The sets have been stripped down to reduce Hogwarts' fairy-book aspects and emphasize its gray medieval character, and even the obligatory Quidditch match is staged with greater attention to spatial comprehensibility than ever before.\rAs the overarching story ramps up toward one major character's death at the end of part six and the final confrontation between Harry and archfiend Voldemort in the climactic \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" which is being shot as a two-part film, this increased seriousness is all to the good. It's hard to imagine watching \"Half-Blood Prince\" as a \"Potter\" virgin without a clue as to what's come before, but it's a formidable entry with a heft and cinematic texture compromised only by a certain lack of dramatic modulation.\rWith the villainess of the last picture, Dolores Umbridge, out of the way but the unseen Lord Voldemort in the ascendant, neither London, subject to a startling opening-scene Death Eater attack, nor Hogwarts itself can be regarded as safe from the Dark Lord's gathering storm. While Dumbledore takes Harry along to recruit former colleague Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as new potions professor and, he hopes, to provide crucial revelations about Voldemort, Harry's student nemesis, Draco Malfoy, prepares to commit a heinous crime designed to pave the way for Voldemort's comeback.\rWhile Harry remains mindful of his status as the \"Chosen One,\" he is not entirely exempt from the lusts, jealousies and intrigues that preoccupy his fellow teenagers as never before. While Harry's growing fondness for Ron's sister Ginny is slowly developing, Ron is a sitting duck for the attentions of the irrepressible Lavender Brown. But, as we know, the brilliant Hermione unaccountably loves the comparatively slow-witted Ron, and she has only Harry's shoulder to cry on when he's not squiring space cadet Luna Lovegood.\rBut assessing the romantic entanglements is not nearly as much fun as simply beholding the big physical changes in the young actors, whose onscreen maturation will have been documented across the span of a decade when all is said and done. The biggest change since \"Phoenix\" two years ago has been registered by Tom Felton, who plays Malfoy; he's now a tall stringbean in the Jimmy Stewart mold, with a face that's come to resemble that of Jonathan Pryce, and he towers over Daniel Radcliffe's Harry, who looks to be the shortest person in the cast (not true when Imelda Staunton was around).\rRupert Grint, as Ron, has always looked a tad older than the others and continues to while showing more character. Emma Watson, perennially appealing as Hermione, has become a very attractive young woman, and Bonnie Wright's Ginny intrigues as the sort of initial plain Jane who keeps growing on you.\rJoining such returning stalwarts as Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Warwick Davis among the Hogwarts staff is Jim Broadbent, who makes a terrific disguised entrance and is then simply grand as the eccentric old prof whom Harry presses for crucial insights into Voldemort; latter's student incarnation as Tom Riddle is seen in two crucial memory sequences.\rIt's this chapter in the Potter saga that obliges the always nasty but ambiguously motivated Severus Snape to show his true colors, and the indispensable Rickman delivers, as always, with line readings that are delicacies of the infinitely mordant kind. He is periodically egged on by the insidious Bellatrix Lestrange, a role Helena Bonham Carter plays with such mesmerizing abandon that one hopes the role fully pays off in the final chapter.\rThe particulars of Dumbledore's final quest with Harry could prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated, although there are unlikely to be many of those in the audience at this stage. Otherwise, the film is clear-headed and clean-lined; now that he's at home with the material, Yates has made a \"Potter\" picture that is less desperate to please than any of its predecessors, itself a sign of series maturity.\rAmong the always outstanding production values and top-drawer visual effects, special note should be made of series newcomer Bruno Delbonnel's exceptionally atmospheric cinematography and Nicholas Hooper's emotionally churning score, which contains only the slightest trace of John Williams' original themes.\rAfter two PG-13-rated entries, this one has won a PG, matching the first three. At 153 minutes, \"Half-Blood Prince\" is the third-longest feature in the series and seems just about right; \"Order of the Phoenix,\" at 138 minutes, actually felt too short.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.401548, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Potter", "body": "Kids&#x27; stuff is a thing of the past in &quot;<em>Harry</em> Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.&quot; Suddenly looking quite grown up, the students at Hogwarts are forced to grapple with heavy issues of mortality, memory and loss in this sixth installment in the series of bigscreen adaptations of J.K.

The righteous renegade, Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan stands as one of the most influential (and satisfying) screen characters of all time, marking a turning point in cop movies after which hard-boiled officers freely erred on the side of excessive force. But the series itself was incredibly conflicted, questioning the very notion of vigilantism even as it established a character who meted out justice via his own personal peacemaker, a .44 Magnum (\"the most powerful handgun in the world\").\rThough Warner's latest Blu-ray edition hardly represents the first time the franchise has been packaged together, public perception of Eastwood has radically changed since the studio last released the films on disc in 2003. In that short time, Eastwood\u00a0\u00a0has cemented\u00a0his standing\u00a0as an Oscar-caliber\u00a0filmmaker\u00a0first and\u00a0movie star second, a\u00a0transition\u00a0that predates the original \"Dirty Harry\" (the title of his directorial debut, \"Play Misty for Me,\" graces a theater marquee in the 1971 film).\rThe wealth of bonus materials included in this latest edition (most heavily loaded on the \"Dirty Harry\" disc, for those who don't buy into the series' commercially motivated sequels) are of two minds. There are a half-dozen or so short docs dedicated to exploring the iconography of both the Dirty Harry character and its star (among the curios unearthed is an early trade ad announcing Frank Sinatra for the role). And then there are the commentaries, including two by film critic and Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel, which explore Eastwood's role as the series' true auteur.\rThat designation is not to strip credit from director Don Siegel, who served as Eastwood's most significant mentor and established the look of the franchise. But it was Eastwood, via his Malpaso production shingle, who tapped his old friend to direct. For the sequels, Eastwood surrounded himself with professionals who could deliver the subsequent films in the most efficient, inexpensive way possible. And when the time came, he even helmed an installment himself, tackling 1983's \"Sudden Impact.\"\rThe original boasts fresh currency today thanks to David Fincher's recent \"Zodiac\" (both films fictionalize the notorious Zodiac killer's reign of terror over San Francisco). But \"Dirty Harry\" -- and this is true of all five films -- also emphasizes a near-constant atmosphere of law-breaking, alternating between its central serial killer and all manner of perceived degenerates: bank robbers, swingers, homosexuals and so on. Harry can't even eat a hot dog in peace without a firefight breaking out.\rThough unmistakably urban, Eastwood's San Francisco was still the West, wilder now than ever, and as gunslingers go, Harry came with his own ambiguities (John Wayne asserts why the character disagreed with him on one of the featurettes). As Schickel delicately puts it, Harry was \"not particularly careful about the rights of criminals and particularly caring about the rights of victims.\" He didn't play fair, extracting confessions through force and shooting bad guys in the back if necessary. Even his trademark .44 Magnum feels like bringing a bazooka to a spitball fight. \"That ain't no cop's gun,\" one hoodlum hisses. By \"The Dead Pool,\" Harry has upgraded to a laughably oversized spear gun (\"But the audiences loved it,\" producer David Valdes shrugs).\rThe character was an equal-opportunity bigot, and in one movie after another, the series provided him with the least compatible partners imaginable: a Mexican-American (Reni Santoni in \"Dirty Harry\"), an African-American (Felton Perry in \"Magnum Force\"), a woman (Tyne Daly in \"The Enforcer\") and a Chinese-American (Evan Kim in \"The Dead Pool\") -- although only the latter is referred to in such politically correct terms onscreen. He could even make a progressive sentiment sound unpopular, as when he sneers, \"If the rest of you could shoot like them, I wouldn't care if the whole damn department was queer,\" in \"Magnum Force.\"\rPartners have a nasty way of ending up dead or severely hospitalized around Harry, although it's interesting to watch how each manages to redeem him- or herself in Callahan's eyes shortly before being gunned down, suggesting that they might be overturning Harry's tightly held stereotypes one by one (remember, the opening image of \"Dirty Harry\" is a monument to fallen San Francisco police officers, and the series never veers in its respect for fallen cops). The recurring theme, of course, is the \"system's\" inability to deliver justice and Harry's willingness to break the law in order to put the criminals in their place. And yet, this time it's never personal with Harry, who draws the line at vigilantism.\rThat tension is most apparent in the first two films in the series, \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Magnum Force,\" after which the political subtext yields to all manner of nutty serial killers. In one of the set's many extras, Eastwood explains \"Magnum Force\" was crafted in reaction to the behavior presented in the first film: \"All of a sudden you go, 'Wait a second. Where are we heading with this?' So socially it probably has more to say than 'Dirty Harry,'\" he says. That first sequel pits Harry around a ring of truly dirty cops who abuse their power, executing the criminals who slip through loopholes in the legal system. It also features the immortal line, \"You're either for us or against us\" -- another zinger with echoes in contemporary politics.\rIt's remarkable that for all the unforgettable lines Dirty Harry has uttered over the years, it's not until the fifth and final film that the character resorts to corny James Bond-style quips. And though his opponents grew progressively more cartoony as the series progressed (\"The Dead Pool\" finds Harry speeding through the streets of San Francisco as the killer chases him with an explosive remote-control car), Eastwood maintained his iconic status through them all. Of course, the very notion of sequels contradicts a character who tossed away his badge at the end of the first film, and yet, as countless voices insist across the set's various commentaries and featurettes, \"The world needs Dirty Harry.\"\rAnd so Eastwood obliged them, entering into a shrewd arrangement with Warner Bros. by which he was able to alternate between starring in commercial hits (Dirty Harry was one of the studio's most bankable characters) and directing passion projects. It's no coincidence that appearing in \"The Dead Pool\" helped justify the existence of \"Bird,\" for example. Of the features Eastwood directed, that Charlie Parker biopic was the first in which he did not also appear (though his role in 1973's \"Breezy\" was technically little more than a cameo), ushering in a new era of creativity for the director -- just one more way in which Dirty Harry made the world a better place.\r\rRead the original Variety reviews:Dirty Harry\rMagnum Force\rThe Enforcer\rSudden Impact\rThe Dead Pool", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.380825, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "Dirty <em>Harry</em>: Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition", "sections": "Dirty <em>Harry</em>: Ultimate Collector\u2019s Edition", "body": "As a symbol, Dirty <em>Harry</em> has been abused by everyone from Ronald Reagan to Arnold Schwarzenegger -- but don&#x27;t hold that against him.

Sensationally exuberant, imaginatively crafted and intoxicatingly clever, \"Josie and the Pussycats\" shrewdly recycles a trifling curio of 1970s pop-culture kitsch as the linchpin for a freewheeling, candy-colored swirl of comicbook adventure, girl-power hijinks and prickly satirical barbs. Though clearly aimed at an under-25 female demographic, pic has sufficient across-the-board appeal to be a crossover hit and should earn a kit and caboodle of cash before lapping up greater riches in ancillary markets.\nWhile remaining reasonably faithful to the spirit of two short-lived (16 episodes each) but much-rerun TV cartoon shows -- \"Josie and the Pussycats\" (1970) and \"Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\" (1972) -- which in turn were inspired by a popular Archie Comics series, writers-directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (\"Can't Hardly Wait\") have slightly expanded the central characters and significantly altered the overall tone.\nAs before, the three leads -- plucky singer-guitarist Josie McCoy (Rachael Leigh Cook), ditzy blond drummer Melody Valentine (Tara Reid) and levelheaded bassist Valerie Brown (Rosario Dawson) -- are the hard-rocking members of a girl group. In this version, however, they're introduced as an unknown garage band, not a successful touring act.\nAnd instead of battling diabolical villains in Aztec pyramids or criminal masterminds near the Grand Canyon, Josie and the Pussycats face the serious challenge of being true to themselves, and to each other, while ensnared in star-making machinery.\nBorrowing a few pages from Peter Watkins' dead-serious \"Privilege\" (1967) and Bob Rafelson's comic-fantasy \"Head\" (1968), Kaplan and Elfont imagine a world in which pre-fab pop stars are manufactured and sold to masses of pliable, trend-conscious teens, while shadowy government-corporate co-conspirators manipulate those masses to maintain social order and, more important, a booming economy. The self-reflective cheekiness is almost breathtaking in its brazenness: \"Josie\" itself is unabashedly a textbook example of the kind of product sold by the system that pic satirizes.\nEarly on, when \"Josie\" introduces DuJour, a fave-rave boy band that's a spot-on burlesque of 'N Sync, the filmmakers bare their satirical claws. From there, it's a quick hop to DuJour's private plane, an aircraft that's top-heavy with product-placements for Target stores, Ivory dish detergent, etc., etc. (Prominent displays of name-brand merchandise serve as a deliciously nasty running gag throughout the pic.)\nUnfortunately, DuJour doesn't remain aloft very long: Their flight is sabotaged by manager Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) after the band members air their suspicions about subliminal messages being added to their songs.\nDriven to find new nobodies who can be transformed overnight into pop music icons, Frame fortuitously arrives in Riverdale, U.S.A., where he discovers Josie and the Pussycats and signs them to a contract with Mega Records. Suddenly they're whisked to New York, and joined for the ride by Alan M. (Gabriel Mann), a dreamy-looking folk singer who's like catnip for Josie; Alexander Cabot (Paulo Costanzo), the group's none-too-bright original manager; and Alexandra Cabot (Missi Pyle), Alexander's sister, a sour-tempered vixen who also has the hots for Alan M.\nIn less than a week, Josie and the Pussycats are chart-topping superstars with millions of frantic fans, oodles of commercial endorsements and a cover-story profile in Rolling Stone. But success comes at a high price. Fiona (Parker Posey), the spectacularly vain-glorious CEO of Mega Records, uses the Pussycat CDs to slip subliminal hard-sell messages into the brains of teens everywhere. Kaplan and Elfont cram so many in-jokes, knowing allusions and on-target parodies into their pic that a second viewing may be mandatory for anyone who wants to savor all of the gags. Funniest bits involve efforts to control trends among teens (\"Gatorade is the new Snapple!\", \"Heath Ledger is the new Matt Damon!\"). No less a notable than Mr. Moviefone is embroiled in the stealthy brainwashing.\nAnd MTV's Carson Daly -- played, in a bold stroke of casting, by Carson Daly -- reveals his true colors as a ruthlessly efficient co-conspirator and potential murderer.\nCook is a nifty Josie, Reid is a funny dumb bunny, and Dawson hits all the right notes. Cumming goes just far enough over the top; Posey goes a little too far. Mann, looking and sounding very much like a younger and less threatening James Spader, is suitably boy-toyish. Costanzo and Pyle are broad but amusing. \nProduction values are just about purr-fect. With a little help from famed record producer Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, who's credited as an executive producer, original songs are irresistibly upbeat with insidiously effective hooks. (Expect massive soundtrack CD sales, and heavy airplay for punkish prom-queenly single \"Three Small Words.\") Production design by Jasna Stefanovich enhances pic's ironic edge with all the name brand glitz and glam that money can buy.\nBut seriously, folks: A strong case could be made for \"Josie and the Pussycats\" as a revealing and richly detailed snapshot of contemporary pop culture. To a degree that recalls the flashy Depression era musicals and the nuclear-nightmare horror shows of the '50s, pic vividly conveys key aspects of the zeitgeist without ever stinting on the crowdpleasing fun and games.\nIt's made for the megaplexes, but it's also one for the time capsule.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.354805, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"sections": "Mick Jagger on <em>Harry</em> Styles: \u2018He Doesn\u2019t Have a Voice Like Mine or Move on Stage Like Me\u2019", "tags": "<em>Harry</em> Elfont", "body": " short-lived (16 episodes each) but much-rerun TV cartoon shows -- &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; (1970) and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; (1972) -- which in turn were inspired by a popular Archie Comics series, writers-directors Deborah Kaplan and <em>Harry</em> Elfont (&quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot;) have slightly"}, "id": "562a69df827a6641e6000680"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "Can\u2019t Hardly Wait", "Emanuel Levy", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "Ricky Gervais\u2019 Netflix Special Draws Criticism for Graphic Jokes Mocking Trans People", "TMZ Seeks to Block Johnny Depp From Calling Ex-Employee to Testify", "\u2018Hunter x Hunter\u2019 Manga Creator Joins Twitter, Teases New Chapters After Four-Year Hiatus", "Matthew McConaughey Issues Call to Action After School Shooting in His Texas Hometown Uvalde: \u2018This Is an Epidemic We Can Control\u2019", "A Child Autopsy, Sexy Intestines and Kristen Stewart: 'Crimes of the Future' Earns Cannes Walkouts and 7-Minute Standing Ovation", "Warner Bros.

Pandering to its target audience by recycling cliches and stereotypes, pic should benefit from its timely release and the fact it's the first of a half dozen promised school movies to hit the bigscreen over the next few months.\nNeophyte directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont can't decide whether to situate their film in the tradition of the more poignant and socially resonant \"American Graffiti\" and \"Dazed and Confused,\" or simply to rehash the conventions of prankish, frivolous party movies like \"Porky's.\" Muddled blend of music, which includes Barry Manilow, '80s disco hits and '90s pop tunes, doesn't help to ground the film in its contempo milieu.  Result is a comedy that's neither authentic in its lingo and concerns, nor universal enough to appeal to broader segments of the audience; it succeeds only partially in conveying the excitement, fear and confusion of that momentous night when adolescence ends and young adulthood begins.\nAs soon as the painful graduation ceremony is over at Huntington Hills High, preparations begin for the real festivity -- a bash at the house of a hysterical hostess (Michelle Brookhurst), whose sole role is to protest the carpet stains, petty thefts and lewd graffiti perpetrated by her guests. First reel is frustratingly weak and raucous, as Lloyd Ahern's restless camera covers a multiracial celebration that includes every imaginable type: jocks, geeks, prom queens, bimbos, nerds, headbangers and a garden variety of misfits. Aspiring writer Preston (Embry), about to leave for a Boston college the next day, has been in love with Amanda (Hewitt), the class knockout, ever since they met during freshman year.\nFour years later, Preston's tormented infatuation with Amanda is even more intense. Holding a precious letter he has written to her, he decides to seize his final opportunity and proclaim love. The timing seems ripe, as Amanda has just been dumped by arrogant b.f. Mike (Peter Facinelli). Their breakup, which seems to concern every student at the party, is one of the few dramatic events in a rather plotless movie.\nIt takes 40 long minutes for the first quiet, meaningful scene to take place, in which Amanda discloses a severe identity crisis: \"If I'm not Mike's girlfriend, who am I?\" Indeed, pic improves considerably as soon as it centers on its half-dozen protagonists, involving viewers emotionally for the first time. Large sections are set in the locked bathroom, where two misfits, Denise (Lauren Ambrose) and childhood friend Kenny (Seth Green), unload four years of emotional baggage.\nSporadically, the writing is sharp, as in a touching scene in which Mike, who broke up with Amanda so that he could be free to pursue his sexually charged fantasies with college women, gets disenchanting advice from an older student, Amanda's cousin Ron (Erik Palladino), regarding the reality that awaits him in college: \"Guys like us are a dime a dozen.\"\nWith obvious echoes of Cameron Crowe's far superior \"Say Anything\" and its unlikely romance between two opposites, last act clears the obstacles between Amanda and Preston. True to form, predictable finale will delight audiences, who may find themselves rooting for the central couple almost by default because there are not many likable characters around.\nPacing in first segments is frantic, later sequences, though, are more sensitive, helping to bring out some acute observations in the more intimate interactions.\nAside from the two charming leads, thesps hitting high points include the attractive Facinelli as the childish, self-absorbed Mike; Charlie Korsmo as a sci-fi-loving, honor-roll geek; Green as a white guy pretending to be a homeboy; and, especially, red-haired Ambrose as Preston's sensitive, introverted confidante who carries more than one chip on her shoulders.\nWith the notable exception of the costumes by Mark Bridges (\"Boogie Nights\"), tech credits are just passable, which may be a reflection of the budget.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.335104, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Elfont", "body": " over the next few months.\nNeophyte directors Deborah Kaplan and <em>Harry</em> Elfont can&#x27;t decide whether to situate their film in the tradition of the more poignant and socially resonant &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; or simply to rehash the conventions of prankish, frivolous party movies like"}, "id": "562bddcce621f44c37000304"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "This Is My Life", "Variety Staff", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "How the \u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2019 Cast Trained to Fly Fighter Jets", "\u2018Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\u2019 Director Teases Slasher Film Plot: \u2018Pooh and Piglet Go on a Rampage\u2019", "Alexis Bledel Exits \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Ahead of Season 5 (EXCLUSIVE)", "Why Was Depp-Heard Trial Televised?

This first biography of the noted big-band trumpeter and husband of glamour queen Betty Grable is a balanced and straightforward portrait of a great showbiz story.\nPeter J. Levinson paints an emotion-free picture of the trumpeter, band leader and baseball fanatic in \"Trumpet Blues,\" consistently favoring facts over interpretation. It truly was a spectacular life that James lived, from his youth spent traveling from town to town in the circus to big-band fame, a 22-year marriage to Grable, gambling and alcohol addictions and a career revival in the casinos of Nevada.\nLevinson, a publicist for jazz musicians whose career began as a talent agent for MCA in the 1950s, knew James for more than two decades. But rather than use that personal connection to drive his prose, he uses it as a starting point for investigation. More than 200 interviews were conducted for the book, and the voices echo an admiration for the man; Levinson's goal, stated in the preface, is only to see James's place in history reassessed.\nTo do so, Levinson lets the aspects of James' life that filled gossip columns dominate the middle of the book --- but that doesn't temper the sizzle with which he lived. James was never out of character, a lifelong womanizer whose skirt-chasing ways were never on hold. But time in and time out in this bio, anecdotal praise is heaped on his ability as a jazz trumpeter, on his ability to get clear and rich tones and his incredible sense of melody. His charm, depending on who's being asked, either played second fiddle to or was inextricably linked to his musicianship.\nOrdered in straight chronology from James' birth in March 1916 up to Frank Sinatra's eulogy at James' funeral on July 7, 1983, Levinson's bio gives each chapter equal weight to stories that feature bars, ballfields and bandstands, from his youth in Texas to later years in Las Vegas. James' love of the ponies and trips to the racetrack with Grable, for example, are given as much space as his early years with Benny Goodman.\nTo his credit, Levinson never gets carried away with any single aspect of James' life save for baseball, the metaphors from which fill James' commentary on life for decades.\nJames' life intersects with virtually every top-shelf musician and movie star of the 1940s. Even without Grable, he was a magnet for Hollywood talent; she only upped the ante, making them one of the first glamour couples from two different realms of entertainment.\nLevinson is fascinated with his subject and seems to find no one with any harsh words for the trumpeter.\nCertainly James' hyperactive libido and the business-first dealings had to break a few hearts and anger some musicians along the way. Then again, he was able to be friends and work with Buddy Rich, one of the most notoriously difficult musicians in the history of jazz.

McCarthy", "popularity": 1, "body": "Anderson goes back to his roots in an effort to exploit his street performer persona -- cynical con man with the face of Howdy Doody. This beguiling illusionist keeps smiling and chattering while parting a fool and his money. But his half-cynicism gets in the way. Fractured hour is driven by the premise that people enjoy being ripped off, or at least seeing others get ripped off, and ends up somewhere between Penn & Teller's subversive approach to magic and the mean showmanship of the carnival.\n Before going before a studio audience seated in a carnival tent, Anderson dupes his fellow \"Dave's World\" actors into betting against his skills. Later, he and apprentice J.C. Wendel swindle other chumps at a make-believe carnival, including John Ritter and Brent Spiner, who make unfunny guest appearances as themselves.\n    Tricks performed in the tent are all old standbys such as interlocking metal hoops, a shell game and card tricks. To show how he performs his first trick -- changing two $ 5 bills belonging to audience members into one $ 10 -- Anderson sheds his coat and drops his drawers to reveal a complicated magician's grappler , which propels bills down his sleeve. It's meant facetiously, and no secrets are ever revealed.\n    With the exception of one good dig at Siegfried and Roy, the jokes are as weary as the tricks. Some of the subtler lines come dangerously close to being non sequiturs.\n    A visit to a real-life magic shop in Azusa is a nicely crafted piece during which Anderson is genuinely charming. Johnson's sketch with his monkey dummy is wonderful, and Davison turns his juggling bit into a graceful variation on modern dance. Both are able to put refreshing twists on their arts.\n    The segments that take place without the studio audience and without a laugh track are flat. The script and its choppy structure are mainly responsible, but director Jim Drake can't seem to meld everything together. Title cards are used to delineate segments, without much purpose or impact.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 24.265568, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "<em>Harry</em> Anderson: The Tricks of His Trade", "sections": "<em>Harry</em> Anderson: The Tricks of His Trade"}, "id": "562ac2434bb81c43b60004a6"}, {"sections": ["optional screen reader", "El Dorado", "Variety Staff", "Latest", "Read More About:", "Most Popular", "Indian American 'Summer of Soul' Producer Joseph Patel Calls Chris Rock \u2018a F\u2014ing Dick\u2019 for Calling Him \u2018White Guy\u2019 During\u2026", "Chris Rock Responds to Will Smith\u2019s Oscars Slap at Standup Show: \u2018I\u2019m Still Kind of Processing What Happened\u2019", "Jim Carrey Shares \u2018Mixed Emotions\u2019 and \u2018Worry\u2019 Over Paul Dano\u2019s Riddler: \u2018To Each His Own\u2019", "Will Smith Was Not Formally Asked to Leave Oscars Following Chris Rock Slap, Sources Claim", "Oscars Producer Will Packer Says LAPD Was Ready to Arrest Will Smith After Chris Rock Slap", "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Writer Takes Leave of Absence After Claims of Exaggerated Medical History", "Daniel Radcliffe \u2018Dramatically Bored of Hearing People\u2019s Opinions\u2019 About Will Smith Oscar Slap", "Academy Starts Disciplinary Proceedings Against Will Smith, Expulsion on the Table", "Academy Leaders and Will Smith Discussed Oscars Slap Before Emergency Board Meeting (EXCLUSIVE)", "TLC Announces Return Dates for \u2018Little People, Big World,\u2019 \u2018Welcome to Plathville\u2019 and Three More Series (EXCLUSIVE)", "Must Read", "Troy Kotsur's Historic Oscar Win for \u2018CODA\u2019 Is Only the Beginning: 'It's Saved My Life, My Career'", "Can Will Smith Recover From the Oscars Slap Fallout?", "Silk Sonic to Open Grammy Awards", "Ariana DeBose Says She\u2019s Discussed Disney\u2019s Handling of \u2018Don\u2019t Say Gay\u2019 Bill With CEO Bob Chapek: \u2018We\u2019re Gonna Do the Work\u2026", "Red Hot Chili Peppers on John Frusciante's Return for New Album \u2014 and Their 40-Year Journey From \u2018Hollywood Street Kids\u2019 to a Walk of Fame\u2026", "Sign Up for Variety Newsletters", "Strictly Business", "More From Our Brands", "Arlo Parks Gets Soulful With \u2018Softly\u2019 Performance on \u2018Colbert\u2019", "Someone Finally Made the All-Electric Bronco Restomod We Always Wanted", "Super Group, Paramount Lead Mixed Month for Sports\u00a0Stocks", "Wondering What To Watch This Weekend?

It's hard to be too hard on any film that features a voice cameo from Kylie Minogue as a nattering razorback boar, or one that requires Eric Bana to deliver the line, \"I once captured 10 Komodo dragons with no more than a pair of budgie smugglers and a bit of Vegemite.\" Yet the longer this crayon-bright tale of zoo animals adrift in the great Aussie outdoors wears on, the less distinctive it seems, its script's naked cribbing from \"Madagascar\" and sundry Pixar chase narratives betraying it as yet another attempt to emulate the house styles of DreamWorks and Disney. As such, Clare Knight and Harry Cripps' film walks the walk well enough. But there's a funnier, more eccentric adventure underneath it all, straining to make its own return to the wild.\r\n\r\nAt the core of \"Back to the Outback\" is a nifty idea that could have been presented with a little more bite: that of an animal kingdom class war between the cute, cuddly creatures beloved of humans, and those seen by man as repulsive, dangerous or frightening. Cripps' screenplay plucks its principal quartet of heroes from the latter camp, with the twist that \u2014 far from the monsters they're billed as at the Sydney zoo where they reside \u2014 they're all teddy bears on the inside.\r\n\r\nYoung taipan snake Mattie (Isla Fisher) can't help the venomous fangs that appear when she gives what she intends as a winsome smile to shrieking onlookers. Her reputation as a predator who can kill scores of people in seconds precedes her, but she's never hurt a soul. Ditto timid, effete scorpion Nigel (Angus Imrie), whose sting is strictly limited to his tail, lovelorn funnel-web spider Frank (Guy Pearce) and thorny devil lizard Zoe (Miranda Tapsell), all of whom live quiet, sedentary lives in separate glass cages alongside Mattie \u2014 when they're not plucked out occasionally for ghoulish public display by Steve Irwin-aping zookeeper Chaz (Bana).\r\n\r\nIt's not the worst of lives, though it pales in comparison to the pampering granted young koala Pretty Boy (Tim Minchin), the zoo's prize attraction and viral celebrity \u2014 and, it turns out, a supremely obnoxious narcissist. Spurred by nightly tales of outback life told by maternal crocodile Jackie (Jacki Weaver, naturally), Mattie and her pals idly dream of a future return to their natural habitat until, following a series of punishing mishaps, they resolve to make a run for it, accidentally snagging a resentful Pretty Boy into their escape mission.\r\n\r\nCue a frantic, somewhat repetitive series of perilous situations and scrapes, as the five mismatched critters variously survive the crossing of Sydney Harbour, the bustle of the big city and, eventually, the unfamiliar obstacles of the wild \u2014 pursued all the while by the blustering Chaz, whose insistent if nonsensical villainy approaches Max Cady levels of stubbornness. It's consistently busy enough to keep very young kids distracted, with a range of dance breaks, comic exchanges and pop-scored montages thrown in to break up the slightly monotonous chase narrative and sweet but obvious inner-beauty messaging. (Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\" even pops up for maximum youth engagement.)\r\n\r\nYet if \"Back to the Outback\" diverts attention, it never quite captures the imagination, in large part because the characters don't have a whole lot of individual personality. Never once finding occasion for her venom, Mattie makes for a particularly wan heroine, her pureness of heart making her rather less amusing than the vain, callow Pretty Boy, though there are no prizes for guessing who has an attitude check coming. Despite the high celebrity quotient (even Keith Urban crops up as a randy, Percy Sledge-crooning frog), the voice work is blandly cheery and indistinct, complementing the film's bright, edgeless style of computer animation, complete with moistly wide-eyed, Pixar-style character design. It's only when \"Back to the Outback\" breaks from this aesthetic for a brief dream sequence in naive 2D, drawing on natural forms and indigenous folk art, that we get a hint of the richer, more culturally specific film this could be.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 23.957615, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"tags": "<em>Harry</em> Cripps", "body": "&#x27;s naked cribbing from &quot;Madagascar&quot; and sundry Pixar chase narratives betraying it as yet another attempt to emulate the house styles of DreamWorks and Disney.

Star, the creator of \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cMelrose Place,\u201d has a gift for skating the viewer across smoothly luxurious settings.\r\n\r\nWhich may be the problem, or one of them, with his latest series for Netflix, which he created with Jeffrey Richman. \"Uncoupled\" features Neil Patrick Harris as Michael Lawson, an haute-Manhattan real-estate agent whose long-term relationship, to a character played by Tuc Watkins, falls apart before Michael even knows it\u2019s broken. Michael is forced to carry on with work and to begin to date, all while pretending he\u2019s not devastated. The trouble is that the show comes to seem distracted by all the pleasures surrounding the challenging character of Michael, refusing to stay still and deliver much of any insight about what a midlife breakup might look like, or mean, for a man who\u2019s been in a monogamous relationship for 17 years. The show thrusts its jitteringly antic \u201cEmily in Paris\u201d energy against a subject, and a character, too lachrymose to generate sparks.\r\n\r\nMichael\u2019s professional life is largely devoted to finding the perfect home for a society doyenne played by Marcia Gay Harden, assisted by his colleague played by Tisha Campbell. Both Harden and Campbell are very funny performers here, but both struggle to play off of Harris, who has made the decision to play Michael as not just sad and grieving but sour and peeved. What's happened to him is clearly upsetting, but Harris' performance whittles down audience sympathy over time. There\u2019s little that is light or fleet in this character, which makes the show\u2019s constant pitching-up of the world around him seem tonally mismatched, or like a compensation.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a long-term gay relationship ending, and the unchartered nature of what it looks like to be single and eligible in a world that accepts gay people but has pushed them toward marriage, is fertile territory. That's why it's disappointing that much of what happens on \u201cUncoupled\u201d is outright surreal, or close to it. Michael confronts the couples therapist whose ministrations led to his breakup while the mental-health professional is moonlighting as a drag performer; the therapist, in character as \"Miss Communication,\" curses him out over his \u201cwhiny-ass voice\u201d and his narcissism. (It's an apt critique, coming from a source we struggle to take seriously: What therapist would so wildly attack a former client, whether in character or not?) Elsewhere, Michael\u2019s attempts to re-enter the dating pool are outright catastrophic, with one potential partner attempting to inject him with Botox in a private region of the body; another, a millennial, explains the concept of PrEP, the use of prophylactic medication to prevent the transmission of HIV.\r\n\r\nThe first couple of these examples feel like the old \u201cSex and the City\u201d formula, put to misguided use: On that show, the unexpectedness of characters\u2019 \u2014 often Samantha\u2019s \u2014 encounters made for fodder for conversation about the oddities of human nature, and the unpredictability of the heart. Here, characters exist solely in relation to Michael and his pool of self-regard, as the world around him simply reflects back that he is the only sane man left. (No wonder he\u2019s single!) As for the case of Michael learning about PrEP for the first time (difficult to believe for a connected and worldly gay man living in New York), it's a cardboard-flat scene that allows him to express disgust at the very concept, lecturing his would-be partner about \u201cwhere you got your freedoms.\u201d\r\n\r\nEveryone can and should make their own choice where matters like PrEP are concerned, but Michael\u2019s instant ratcheting-up of dudgeon reveals the character, once again, as set in his ways and a bit windy in his disgust for those who don\u2019t meet his standards. Harris doesn\u2019t quite let us in on the joke that's in the script, that Michael is self-aggrandizing to a fault. The generation-gap material here might have given rise to real insight about who Michael is; \u201cUncoupled\u201d gestures this way when his young date brushes him off, calling him a \u201cbitter old queen.\u201d But then the zazzy music picks up and the scene ends, just as we were getting somewhere. We move to lunch with Michael and two friends (Brooks Ashmanskas and Emerson Brooks), who vaguely address the topic with a few digs and sex jokes, and then the subject changes.\r\n\r\nLater, Michael vents that he\u2019s simply not meant to date \u2014 he\u2019s meant to be part of the long-term relationship he once enjoyed. Fair enough, but this show is about him trying to date, and his dragging himself through a world he eyes with contempt makes the sparkle and glitter of New York feel less like an asset than like an attempt to distract from the center of the frame. The process of kissing frogs before meeting one's prince has made for some great fiction, but Michael's disengagement from this process, his high-handed unwillingness to be part of the story \"Uncoupled\" is telling in the first place, makes for wearying viewing. \u201cUncoupled,\u201d by its conclusion, feels like a tour of the city\u2019s luxuries with someone unhappy to be sharing them with you, and an examination of modern life hosted by someone who can\u2019t stop complaining that the past ended. This creates less dramatic tension than audience exhaustion; for all that Emily\u2019s Paris is a frivolous place, at least there, people stop complaining now and again to allow the story to move.\r\n\r\n\"Uncoupled\" premieres all eight episodes on Netflix on Friday, July 29.", "info": "", "_index": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000004", "_type": "56297a5fd3b687ca9b000005", "_score": 23.464941, "_version": null, "_explanation": null, "sort": null, "highlight": {"title": "&#x27;Uncoupled&#x27; Is a Surprisingly Sour Neil Patrick <em>Harris</em> Breakup Story: TV Review", "sections": "\u2018Uncoupled\u2019 Is a Surprisingly Sour Neil Patrick <em>Harris</em> Breakup Story: TV Review", "tags": "Neil Patrick <em>Harris</em>"}, "id": "62e14a3328ccbce2a3d2f267"}]}, "info": {"page": {"query": "duplicity harry cleven", "current_page": 1, "num_pages": 25, "per_page": 100, "total_result_count": 2455, "facets": {"topics": {"Reviews": 2455, "Markets & Festivals": 290, "Festivals": 76, "Awards": 64, "News": 47, "Features": 22, "Global": 19, "Album Reviews": 17, "Spotlight": 16, "Concert Reviews": 7, "Asia": 4, "Opinion": 1, "People News": 1, "TV Reviews": 1}, "author": {"Variety Staff": 260, "Paul Harris": 180, "Todd McCarthy": 125, "Peter Debruge": 116, "Brian Lowry": 114, "Dennis Harvey": 98, "Joe Leydon": 60, "Justin Chang": 55, "Derek Elley": 54, "Marilyn Stasio": 52, "Tony Scott": 51, "David Benedict": 47, "Owen Gleiberman": 47, "Robert L.
