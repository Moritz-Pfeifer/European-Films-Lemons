It embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from.<br /><br />With such a broad scope; it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long, but here is where \\\"Farscape\\\" really comes into it's own element...It succeeds where all others have failed, especially the likes of Star Trek (a universe with practically zero Kaos element!) They ran out of ideas pretty quickly + kept rehashing them! Over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole. This structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues. I happened to see the pilot (Premiere) in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if Crichton would ever \\\"Get the girl\\\", after seeing them all on television I was delighted to see them available on DVD & I have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst I had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia...Farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights...<br /><br />Do yourself a favour; Watch the pilot and see what I mean...<br /><br />Farscape Comet\",\n          \"Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie, after all I thought Steve Carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I'll start with what is right with this movie: at certain points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing. He's an undoubtedly talented individual, and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.<br /><br />The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.<br /><br />The family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie. No family behaves like this. It's almost as if they've been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7. It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling, and talent shows ARE NOT HOW ACTUAL PEOPLE BEHAVE. It's almost sickening.<br /><br />Another big flaw is the woman Carell is supposed to be falling for. Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded.<br /><br />It makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After thinking further, I don't think it was much.\",\n          \"The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.<br /><br />It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.<br /><br />I does give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":56}],"source":[" # Load IMDB data and set labels\n","data_imdb = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Cineuropa_Project/IMDB_Dataset.csv')\n","data_imdb.sentiment.replace(['positive', 'negative'], [1, 0], inplace=True)\n","\n","#Display 5 random samples\n","data_imdb.sample(5)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TxkdXWeuFhsC"},"source":["Split data 127 top, 382 bottom"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YdqIWuNWIufr"},"outputs":[],"source":["def truncate_top_bottom(text):\n","  # naively splitting the text based on space\n","  text_tokens = text.split(' ')\n","\n","  if len(text_tokens) > 509:\n","    top_text = text_tokens[0:127]\n","    bottom_text = text_tokens[len(text_tokens) - 382 - 1:-1]\n","\n","    text = \" \".join([str(item) for item in top_text]) + \" \" + \" \".join([str(item) for item in bottom_text])\n","\n","  return text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lMWtToFIGr-p"},"outputs":[],"source":["data_imdb['review_truncate'] = data_imdb['review'].apply(lambda x: truncate_top_bottom(x))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mfoqrytCvixZ"},"source":["The training data set is split into two sets: a train set with 90% of the data and a validation set with 10% of the data.

a protective son who is worried about his mother marrying a career crook — only to discover that an occasional heist might actually bring some spice to his own life.',\n"," 'This likeable, terribly contrived charmer is helped by a game cast that almost gets away clean, ultimately hampered by a script that impishly (but not always confidently) switches between tones.',\n"," 'The Innocent\\xa0is filled with goofy good cheer\\n\\nGarrel’s fourth feature screens Out of Competition at this year’s Cannes (it was the 75th anniversary special selection), where he’s also appearing in Valeria Bruni Tedeschi’s Competition entry\\xa0Forever Young.',\n"," 'He’s joined by Roschdy Zem, Noémie Merlant and Anouk Grinberg, and the film’s appealing date-night trappings should make it a solid theatrical performer.',\n"," '(The Innocent\\xa0arrives in French theatres on October 12.)',\n"," 'As the story begins, widowed ichthyologist Abel (Garrel) is being informed by his impetuous actress mother Sylvie (Grinberg) that she is once again remarrying — this time to Michel (Zem), a criminal she met while teaching theatre in prison.',\n"," 'After being incarcerated for five years, he’s about to get out, which fills Abel with trepidation: is marrying a recividist burglar a smart idea?',\n"," 'Consequently, Abel is immediately suspicious of his new stepfather, despite the insistence of his flirty friend Clémence (Merlant) that Michel seems harmless.',\n"," 'Because Zem plays Michel with such weary grace, adamant that he’s a changed man, the character automatically seems too good to be true, and Abel’s worries will turn out to be well-founded.',\n"," 'It would be unsporting to reveal precisely what Michel is plotting, but his next scheme will end up involving Abel and Clémence, who are working through their own complicated feelings for one another.',\n"," '(She clearly fancies him, but he’s still mourning his wife, whom he lost in a car accident while he was behind the wheel.)',\n"," 'The Innocent\\xa0sports ample fizzy pleasures, including the zesty rapport between Garrel and Merlant, whose characters seems to have an inevitable destiny.',\n"," 'Then there’s the screenplay, cowritten by Garrel, which includes some coy commentary about the similarities between acting and crime, all the while manufacturing excuses for Abel and Clémence to be in close proximity to one another once Michel’s purposed heist faces predictable complications.',\n"," 'To be sure, the film emphasises laughs and love over suspense, and Garrel directs the material with a breezy confidence that suggests the audience should simply savour the time in the company of such delightfully flawed characters.',\n"," 'Even so,\\xa0The Innocent\\xa0is so lightweight — and its twists and turns so flimsily constructed — that it shortchanges the emotional undercurrent coursing through the picture.',\n"," 'Beneath the slick surface — the crime-caper plot, the unexpected gunplay — the picture is chiefly focused on the anxieties of opening oneself up to love.',\n"," 'Abel disapproves of his mother’s constant rushing into new marriages — she’s had three in the last 10 years — while, conversely, he’s so scarred by the death of his wife that he has closed himself off from possible new relationships, even though Clémence is right there in front of him.',\n"," 'As Sylvie, Grinberg is luminous playing a resilient, enthusiastic woman who has never given up on the idea of finding happiness, no matter how many times it has eluded her in the past.',\n"," 'Subtly, the film hints that Abel has learned to be so cautious about love, in part, because he views his mother as being so reckless about matters of the heart.',\n"," 'Although\\xa0The Innocent\\xa0is filled with goofy good cheer, Garrel tends to overdo the story’s playful ludicrousness, allowing what’s potentially romantic about the scenario to get lost in the narrative busyness.',\n"," 'The central heist is meant to be a bit of audience misdirection, but it can distract from the most fetching elements of this genre mashup.',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n","

'\\n\\nSource: San Sebastián International Film Festival\\n\\n‘The Rite Of Spring’\\n\\nDir: Fernando Franco.',\n"," 'Spain.',\n"," '2022.',\n"," '110mins\\n\\nFollowing films about borderline personality disorder (Wounded) and dying (Morir), further evidence that Spanish auteur Fernando Franco enjoys negotiating ethically tricky terrain comes with The Rite of Spring.',\n"," 'The challenging tale of the strange relationship between a repressed Christian woman and a boy with cerebral palsy deserves top marks for daring, is undoubtedly crafted with care and, despite its austerity, is Franco’s most accessible work to date.',\n"," 'The script is far more interested in presenting interactions in exquisite detail than it is in putting flesh on the characters involved\\n\\nThat austerity – in line with his previous work – makes for an intellectually stimulating but somewhat chilly viewing experience.',\n"," 'But of course some viewers prefer their artistry to be uncontaminated by emotion, making it likely that Spring, following its appearance in San Sebastian’s official section, will dance into the festival and art house circuits.',\n"," 'The setup unfolds as slowly and deliberately as the rest of this very careful film.',\n"," 'Laura (Valeria Sorolla, making her debut) is a university student from out of town, alone and lost in Madrid and living at a residence for Catholic girls.',\n"," 'After a rather too drawn-out setup following a party, she ends up accidentally wandering into the bedroom of David (Telmo Irureta), the host’s brother.',\n"," 'Telmo has cerebral palsy, pictures of naked women all over his walls, and the kind of spontaneous, open smile that wins us over instantly.',\n"," 'At his request, Laura scratches his neck for him, instantly planting the seed of a physical relationship, and goes on her way.',\n"," 'David has a blog, on which he discusses the question of sexual assistance for people like him.',\n"," 'Initially intrigued, Laura, bit by bit and guided by David’s mother Isabel (Emma Suarez), takes on the role herself.',\n"," 'These early scenes explore an area of experience with which many will be entirely unfamiliar, and the film’s strongest scenes, played out in an atmosphere of almost unbearable fear and trembling punctuated with moments of necessary comic relief, are those which chart what the experience is like for both of them.',\n"," 'We should be set for a really interesting relationship.',\n"," 'Laura, it seems, is not merely being altruistic.',\n"," 'As evidenced by a couple of failed flings she has with other guys and by the fact that we see her early on buying a vaginal dilator, she’s using the experience to work through sexual issues of her own.',\n"," 'Matters inevitably become more complicated when the relationship threatens to become more than just transactional, with Laura’s clinical approach to the problem—she’s a chemist, after all— likely to raise eyebrows.',\n"," 'One problem with The Rite of Spring is that the script is far more interested in presenting interactions in exquisite detail than it is in putting flesh on the characters involved, giving things an airless, remote feel.',\n"," 'This feels in direct conflict with the viewers’ wish to delve deeper into the complex situation than Franco has so laboriously set up, and with which he presumably wishes us to engage.',\n"," 'Neither the viewer nor Laura ever learn much more about David than that he enjoys sex and old blues records, and that he’s very funny indeed: we have only access to Laura’s limited view of him.',\n"," 'And the issue is even more damaging with Laura herself, whose true motives ultimately remain an enigma.',\n"," 'At what price working out your sexual issues?',\n"," 'Who’s using whom, and should they be?',\n"," 'There are points where the script should probably be asking Laura to explaining her motives to David, but it doesn’t do so, and the effect is to make her come over as not only repressed, but—if not vaguely sociopathic—then at least lacking in self-awareness.',\n"," '(There may be a critique of Laura’s Catholic education here, but The Rite of Spring doesn’t really seem the place for it.)',\n"," 'One feels that both the characters, and the brave actors playing them, deserve more: it’s almost as though, having set up this uncommon and intriguing situation, the script lacks the imaginative power to fully explore its human consequences, to engage the viewer too closely with the high emotional stakes.',\n"," 'Michael Haneke, for example, knows that its possible to weld analysis to powerful emotion.',\n"," 'But it’s easier, perhaps, just to show the characters doing what they do, to keep things as exquisite as the ironical, culturally charged title suggests they will be, and to let the audience make up their own minds about everything.',\n"," 'Slowly the story advances, as though continually concerned about giving offence: the pacing rarely varies and, like some of the dialogue, is rather plodding.',\n"," 'But given all that, the visuals are beautifully composed, both the central performances are terrific and, along with some fascinating unanswered questions, that smile of David’s, the most open and unaffected thing about this too-restrained film, lingers in the mind long after it has ended.',\n"," '\\n\\nSource: House Productions\\n\\n‘The Wonder’\\n\\nDir: Sebastian Lelio.',\n"," 'UK/Ireland.',\n"," '2022.',\n"," '108mins\\n\\nFaith is at the centre of The Wonder;\\xa0which is just as true for Chilean director Sebastian Lelio, who trusts that this tormented psychological period piece will never become too much for us to bear.',\n"," 'Florence Pugh plays a 19th-century English nurse sent to Ireland for a strange assignment — monitoring a religious 11-year-old who has reportedly not eaten for four months, claiming that she subsists on “manna from Heaven” — and in the process delivers a performance that’s as gripping as anything she’s put on screen.',\n"," 'Adapting Emma Donoghue’s novel, Lelio sometimes ratchets up the intensity too high, but the picture’s unbending severity becomes a virtue in and of itself: like the cloistered community in which Pugh’s character finds herself, The Wonder permits no escape.',\n"," 'Florence Pugh\\xa0delivers a performance that’s as gripping as anything she’s put on screen\\n\\nScreening at Telluride and Toronto, this Netflix release will soon play San Sebastian and London, later hitting the streaming platform in early December.',\n"," 'Pugh’s other award-season release, Don’t Worry Darling, has attracted more attention, but this is the superior picture.',\n"," 'Appealing to arthouse audiences familiar with Lelio from Gloria and the Oscar-winning A Fantastic Woman, The Wonder may prove too prickly for mainstream crowds — indeed, this is a film that’s easier to respect than love.',\n"," 'The year is 1862, and Lib (Pugh) travels by boat to Ireland, where a small-town community has hired her to observe Anna (Kila Lord Cassidy); a girl who has fasted for months but claims to be in perfect health.',\n"," 'This devoutly religious population wants Lib to confirm whether they’re witnessing a miracle, which Lib highly doubts.',\n"," 'But the more time she spends with Anna, the more concerned she gets about this young woman and the rural town where she resides.',\n"," 'Lelio’s follow-up to Gloria Bell, his English-language remake of Gloria, isn’t quite a horror film, but one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.',\n"," 'Thanks to Matthew Herbert’s anxiety-inducing percussive score and Ari Wegner’s magnificently gloomy shots of sweeping Irish countryside, The Wonder hums with unease.',\n"," 'Even Cassidy’s serenely

a claustrophobic tone that’s palpable but also a bit overdone.',\n"," 'Lib and Will’s relationship escalates a little too quickly to be entirely believable, and likewise some of Lib’s decisions regarding how to handle Anna feel rushed.',\n"," 'In addition, Lelio introduces a framing device in which, at the start and the end of the film, we see the studio sets where The Wonder is being shot — a device meant to underline the fact that all stories, including the one we’re watching and the ones The Wonder’s characters tell themselves about their unhappy lives, is constructed.',\n"," 'But considering that everything from The Souvenir: Part II to the recent HBO remake of Scenes From A Marriage has incorporated a similar narrative technique, this meta approach isn’t quite so novel anymore.',\n"," 'That said, Pugh’s agonised turn keeps us riveted, her Lib determined to get to the truth – even if it’s not the answer this God-fearing community wants to hear.',\n"," 'There is no shortage of ideas bouncing around in The Wonder: the terrible treatment of women in patriarchal communities, the ways in which we never recover from the loss of a loved one, our need to believe in a higher power to make sense of our misery.',\n"," 'Those themes are reflected in Pugh’s stern expressions and defiant eyes, the actress playing a nurse who starts off suspicious of Anna but comes to connect with the young woman, both of them trapped in their own circumstance.',\n"," 'In such an unforgiving climate, perhaps they’ll eventually find transcendence.',\n"," '\\n\\nSource: San Sebastián

Helena, but also the team leader, and opening up tears in the fragile fabric of the economic structure binding this motley crew of people together.',\n"," 'At one point, as they make Ivan the butt of a joke in French that he can’t understand, Karim and Helena seem strangely complicit; a less subtle film would have them entering into a relationship, but here the impact is felt merely in Ivan’s increasing insecurity.',\n"," 'Suro tells its tale unfussily and efficiently, with few stylistic flourishes: this is solid, traditional film making, as perhaps befits its subject.',\n"," 'But just because a situation is replete with particular themes doesn’t necessarily mean that has to dutifully deal with them all, and there is inevitably something perfunctory about the film’s\\xa0attempt to

charge who seek to tame her.',\n"," 'Anti-authoritarian landmarks such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest are obvious antecedents, but the chillingly matter-of-fact tone gives this film its own special power, raging at a patriarchal society with eloquently controlled fury.',\n"," 'Unruly\\xa0makes its mark by slowly establishing its characters and this specific world, and then repeatedly

meted out by those running the institution.',\n"," 'Despite occasional moments of high emotional intensity, Reymann resists leaning into the inherently (and arguably warranted) melodramatic elements of this story.',\n"," 'Instead, Unruly is reserved, trusting the viewer will be suitably outraged on behalf of Maren and her cohorts.',\n"," 'This nightmarish, inexplicable situation in which these young women have found themselves creates a sickening sense of claustrophobia: the island is lovingly photographed by Sverre Sordal, which only amplifies the queasy disconnect between the beautiful surroundings and Maren’s predicament.',\n"," 'Maren must also contend with Sorine (Dinnage), a tightly-wound resident who tells on the others when they step out of line, hoping that by currying favour with Miss Nielsen she’ll be allowed a brief getaway to reunite with someone important to her.',\n"," 'The character is initially conceived to be a joyless busybody who resents Maren’s defiance and outgoing demeanour, but Unruly surprises us with some of the transformations in store for Sorine.',\n"," 'Dinnage is marvellous at making Sorine unexpectedly sympathetic over the course of the picture.',\n"," 'Likewise, Maren is far from the stereotypical Randle McMurphy-style rabble-rouser, with Kroyer Koppel deftly expressing this woman’s growing dread about being trapped at the institution.',\n"," 'It’s bad enough that Maren has lost her freedom — as Unruly unspools, she will learn that even more can be taken away from her.',\n"," 'A plot twist about halfway through is handled sensitively by Reymann, and from that point on, Kroyer Koppel finds a new register for her shattered character, as does Dinnage.',\n"," 'A closing title card indicates that Unruly is dedicated to “the women who were put in the Sprogo Women’s Home from 1923-1961,” and while the film ends on what might be considered a hopeful note, Reymann seems to have no illusions about the way women remain policed by the patriarchy.',\n"," 'There’s scant physical abuse heaped on the institution’s inmates, but the mental torture — filling them with shame about their bodies, forcing them to become silent and compliant — never stops, often delivered with patronising smiles from the likes of Wildenskov and Miss Nielsen.',\n"," 'Maren’s great crime was wanting to enjoy her life;\\xa0Unruly soberly

Pla nuances well—is soon getting a tattoo of Julia’s name, fighting with the kids over the remote control, and verbally abusing one of Julia’s old school friends, Alex (Lluis Marques) in one of the marvellously authentic and intense scenes that pepper the film.',\n"," 'Things seem to be taking a turn towards the domestic abuse drama when suddenly we get one of those ellipses that are Rosales’ hallmark.',\n"," 'Franky implausibly—he’s doesn’t really seem like the kind of chap to let things go and move on—Oscar disappears from both the film and from Julia’s life.',\n"," 'She takes the kids down to Melilla to give things a second go with Marcos, a different kind of man as we can see when we witness him delicately ironing a shirt to the accompaniment of opera.',\n"," 'The key scene during this second section has the well-intentioned but slightly useless Marcos, to the absolute anguish of both parents, losing their daughter during a game of hide and see.',\n"," 'Rosales adds another ellipsis here, as we realise that the script has chosen to be less interested in showing the narrative consequences of events, otherwise known as plot, than in the effects of them on people, otherwise known as character.',\n"," 'It can be disorienting, but it works.',\n"," 'Meanwhile, Alex is still around —a potential third chance, waiting in the wings for Julia: another boyfriend, another house move.',\n"," 'Things start to drag a little through this third movement, but it slowly mounts to a wonderfully understated conclusion, one that’s quietly empowering in a film that could so easily have been miserabilist.',\n"," 'In much of Rosales’ previous work, the self-conscious stylishness has often created a distance between the characters and the audience, the longueurs, for example, generously giving the critics time to select their adjectives while around them people quietly nod off.',\n"," 'No such danger here, with the pacing generally swift.',\n"," 'Rosales and director of photography Helene Louvart save the eye-catching camerawork for certain key moments, as for example when Oscar talks directly into camera to us as well as to Julia: the effect is scary.',\n"," 'A

performance of a superbly written role makes any such distance impossible.',\n"," 'Under the impact of these various relationships, the resilient Julia’s journey to maturity, through a terrain strewn with emotional obstacles, is replete with not only suffering, but also joy—for a Rosales film, and for a film on this subject, there is much quiet humour.',\n"," 'One transformation scene late on, as Julia’s world collapses around her, is excruciating in its rawness, and she emerges from it a different person, one whom we can no longer imagine getting involved with an ape like Oscar.',\n"," 'And it’s a moving journey too, because it’s one being made not for Julia herself, but for her children, who need a family structure.',\n"," 'Wild Flowers has much to say on the difficulty of undertaking that most basic, human of tasks nowadays, when you don’t have a good education, or a regular job, or money, and when all the men you meet are useless in one way or another.',\n"," 'None of this is made explicit, though: it comes via a multitude of tiny, accumulated details, such as the hesitant, heartbreaking little nod that is Julia’s response to one of the boys saying he loves her, as though

the grandeur – and all of that is at the heart of Il Boemo, a sumptuous costume piece that’s also an ambitious slice of musical archaeology.',\n"," 'This prestige piece by writer-director Petr Vaclav (The Way Out, We Are Never Alone) unearths the forgotten biography of an 18th-century Czech composer, along with his work.',\n"," 'The latter re-emerges to glorious effect in a visually and musically vivid film that, while it undoubtedly labours under some staid period drama conventions, largely transcends them with its ripely conceived backstage and bedroom intrigue.',\n"," 'Has the expansive

Myslivecek is not as famous as certain contemporaries, it may be because the world has found it as hard to pronounce his name, much like numerous characters n the film; but it’s also perhaps because

her to the big aria, and the will-she-sing-or-won’t-she?',\n"," 'set piece is handled with delicious teasing suspense.',\n"," 'Much of the drama is handled with a certain decorous measure, and it could be said that Dyk’s dignified lead performance suffers from the same problems as Ryan O’Neal’s period role in Barry Lyndon: namely, that he comes across as a graceful hanger for the frockcoats and perukes, without revealing quite enough of the soul beneath.',\n"," 'But overall, the drama requires Josef to respond to the figures around him – which include the scatologically obsessed young King of Naples ((a droll\\xa0Mirco Ciccariello)\\xa0and a precocious Viennese whiz named Wolfgang Mozart (in a delicious sequence in which the tyke improvises the bejesus out of a theme of Josef’s).',\n"," 'With its action moving between Prague, Munich and various Italian cities, and dialogue mainly in Italian but with some Czech and touches of German and English, Il Boemo – the popular name given to the Czech, or ‘Bohemian’, composer – has the expansive feel of a de luxe mini-series in a elegantly compressed, handsomely gilded 140-minute frame.',\n"," 'The narrative may be emotionally engaging only in fits and starts, and a Prague sequence - in which Dyk plays both Josef and his disapproving twin brother – feels more informative than properly dramatic.',\n"," 'When the drama itself flags, however, the music catches fire magnificently.',\n"," 'It is performed by the Collegium 1704 ensemble under harpsichordist and conductor Vaclav Luks, with an eminent cast of singers including Simona Saturova, who contributes the stage voice of La Gabrielli in all its stratospheric glory.',\n"," 'Production designers Irena Hradecka and Luca Servino capture the period to a

only towards the end that the film slightly overplays its hand, with a brief but awkward lurch into action thriller mode that also incongruously ramps up the urban-warzone atmospherics.',\n"," 'Firmly anchoring the film, however, is the portrait of an isolated man whose life has temporarily lost its compass, but who comes to find new purpose as he connects socially, politically and linguistically with the people around him, far from the cultural ivory tower he initially seems to inhabit.',\n"," 'Minujín – whose recent high-profile work includes Fernando Meirelles’ The Two Popes and Lucrecia Martel’s Zama – gives a thoughtful performance that’s compelling but unshowy, capturing what’s self-absorbed and neurotic about this hero, as well as his virtues.',\n"," 'Alfredo Castro gives a charismatic, level-headed performance that’s miles from the edgy eccentricity he’s often associated with, while Lennie brings wry warmth to a slightly thin role, after her lead in Lerman’s 2017\\xa0A Sort of Family.',\n"," 'The teenage cast contribute spiky, totally convincing energy, with veteran Rita Cortese getting a juicy role as the school’s no-bullshit principal.',\n"," 'An end credits number by pungently named Argentinian rapper Shitstem caps an ending that’s emotionally satisfying, although Lerman and his co-writers also have the commendable nerve to leave some key narrative threads tantalisingly unresolved.',\n"," 'DoP Staron doesn’t often go for the expressionist angle, but when he does – notably in a striking opening shot that establishes Lucio’s isolation – it

parts totalling just over four hours, Argentinian director Laura Citarella’s third and fourth features recount, from two points of view, the search for a woman who has vanished.',\n"," 'But quite early on we cease to care much about whether she’s found or not, as the journey to the truth is where all the fun lies.',\n"," 'Lengthy it may be, but this is light-of-touch fare, provocative and satisfyingly enigmatic, and though it feels like a four-hour MacGuffin, it remains an accomplished, literary and self-referential exercise in narrative deferral.',\n"," 'The attentive viewer will succumb to these new, slow rhythms without feeling that they are participants in some indulgent auteur experiment\\n\\nThis follow-up of Ostende, Citarella’s 2011 debut, has screened at Venice and will close the Zabaltegi-Tabakalera section at San Sebastian before heading for the New York Film Festival.',\n"," 'Such exposure will hopefully generate a wider fan base for the alternative charms of the output of both its independent production collective, El Pampero—Trenque Lauquen shares many of the stylistic and thematic concerns of the collective’s other films, and of Citarella specifically.',\n"," 'Near Trenque Lauquen, a rural town in the middle of the Argentinian pampa, Laura (Laura Paredes), a local government worker whose job is classifying the region’s flowers and who moonlights as a radio presenter, has gone missing.',\n"," 'Garrulous academic Rafael (Rafael Spregelburd), her partner, and largely silent council delivery man Ezequiel (the bearded, bearlike Ezequiel Pierri), who we will see was her lover as the flashbacks mount up, set off to find Laura, following the slightest of clues—for example, that she had only one last orchid to classify before her job was done.',\n"," 'As Rafael knocks uselessly on doors, an intriguing backstory builds up in flashback as Laura and Ezequiel go off in a parallel search of the truth—a big concept in this film, in which there are always multiple versions of it—about a 1960s love affair that satisfyingly plays out in letters now hidden in the pages of books in the local library, and which Ezequiel and Laura read out to one another.',\n"," 'Inevitably Ezequiel, who starts to imagine himself in the role of the lover, falls in love with the largely indifferent Laura.',\n"," 'When Ezequiel kisses her, after about 100 minutes, it’s about as close as Part 1 comes to anything resembling a conclusive event.',\n"," 'Part 2 continues in the same stylistic vein, but feels very different, adding a science-fiction angle with the appearance of a mysterious, ghost-like woman (Juliana Muras), who introduces a note of danger largely absent from Part 1.',\n"," 'But the issues now are different: as one female character asks, “What makes you think that Laura wants to be found?” This is something that the men, of course, have failed to consider, and so in Part 2 they are discarded: the truth about what has happened to her will now come from the point of view of Laura herself, aided by various women.',\n"," 'There is forbidding slow, and there is audience-friendly slow, and Trenque Lauquen is very much the latter.',\n"," '(For the purposes of comparison, Mariano Llinas’ Citarella-produced La Flor (2018), another Pampero multi-parter, shook the scales at a cool 808 minutes.)',\n"," 'Standard lengths of scene and sequence are among the conventions that Citarella is challenging: one two-minute scene in Part 2, shot by the side of a lake in the early morning following a strange discovery, for example, seems to be reminding the viewer how to slow down and look carefully: and to think.',\n"," 'But we also spend a long time watching multiple real-time conversations unfold between the characters in this very verbal film - tedium is rarely an issue.',\n"," 'Partly because the characters are so open, engaging and committed to their pursuit of the truth, and partly because the conversations are so delicately nuanced and entertainingly quirky, the attentive viewer will succumb to these new, slow rhythms without feeling that they are participants in some indulgent auteur experiment.',\n"," 'Crucially, Trenque Lauquen is all about real people being excited by ideas, rather than about the ideas themselves.',\n"," 'Fittingly for a film whose aim is to do things differently, the characters’ various investigations do lead them into some fascinating side alleys of alternative history—Lady Godiva plays a part, for example, as does Alexandra Kollontai, a revolutionary nineteenth-century Marxist feminist: the supposed appearance of the strange being in the lake is described by one character as “a trick to keep people entertained and scared while the politicians push through a privatisation project”.',\n"," 'This notion feels very 2021, and comes more to the fore in Part 2, where the narrative weight falls almost exclusively on the shoulders of Laura.',\n"," 'The often quirky events of rural Argentinian life are also explored with affection by the director, whose family hails from the town: the local radio station sequences, for example, with their amusingly surreal phone-ins and internal rivalries, mean there is room for a more broad humour too.',\n"," 'Music also is key to the mood of Trenque Lauquen, with Chopin’s Etudes underscoring the trembling delicacy of

(Metamorphoses) and a Demy-esque romantic musical (Love Songs), Honoré’s directorial identity has not been easy to get a fix on.',\n"," 'His new film Winter Boy could change the picture.',\n"," 'It not only reconnects with key themes of his previous work - the ebbs and flows of gay desire (Sorry Angel), sibling love-hate tensions (Dans Paris) - it’s also arguably his most personal film, and emotionally and stylistically his richest.',\n"," 'It features a beautifully affecting central performance from young lead Paul Kircher – for whom this is surely a star-is-born moment – and superb support from Juliette Binoche.',\n"," 'A moving but hard-edged story of grief, self-discovery and teenage angst, it should resonate well beyond the festival world following Toronto and San Sebastian exposure, although it will score especially with young and LGBT+ aficionados of European art cinema.',\n"," 'A film whose emotions are carried off with a lightness that seems almost casual, until the register is turned up drastically.',\n"," 'Set in the months leading up to Christmas, the film is indeed wintry in feel, yet much warmer and more tender than its English title would suggest.',\n"," 'Inspired by Honoré’s memories of his own father’s death, Winter Boy begins in a mountainous region of southwestern France, where 17 year-old Lucas (Kircher) attends boarding school in Chambéry.',\n"," 'He and his father (Honoré himself) have a close shave on the road at the very start, and this false alarm presages his father’s death soon after.',\n"," 'Lucas is summoned from school to join his mother Isabelle (Binoche) and older brother Quentin (Honoré regular Vincent Lacoste) – and finds his response to bereavement fluctuating between acute agony and numbed confusion.',\n"," 'After a furious set-to with Quentin - fraternal love and hate separated by the thinnest membrane – the older sibling, an artist based in Paris, invites Lucas to come and stay with him for a week.',\n"," 'They leave the next morning, after Lucas stops off for a farewell bout of sex with his lover from school, Oscar (Adrien Casse).',\n"," 'Winter Boy, it is worth noting, is not a coming-out drama, as Lucas is very much out from the start, but it is very much a coming-of-age story in the sense of an apprenticeship in self-discovery.',\n"," 'In Paris, Lucas finds himself at once lost and liberated, as he falls for Quentin’s flatmate Lilio (Erwan Kepoa Falé), an artist of Italian and African heritage, who has a sideline as a sex worker.',\n"," 'Lucas, discovering his own sexual power as a desirable young thing, makes an assignation with a client of Lilio’s, leading to ructions.',\n"," 'This is just part of the contradiction-laden journey that the film dramatises so provocatively: a flowing but fragmented narrative structure, slyly edited by Chantal Hymans, at one point juxtaposes Lucas’s first Parisian hook-up and his brief theological discussion with a priest.',\n"," 'What appears to be a burst of rebellious hedonism takes a darker, distressing turn when Lucas returns home and his trajectory comes to a self-destructive head.',\n"," 'Meanwhile, if Isabelle seems emotionally sidelined throughout – the story placing her widowed grief on the back burner to focus on her solicitous maternal empathy – her own feelings are given space to emerge fully in a late sequence that Binoche absolutely owns.',\n"," 'Despite its impression of flowing associative looseness, the film is anchored by an intermittent first-person narrative from Lucas himself, sometimes framed interview-style against a black background, an unreliable witness to his own feelings.',\n"," 'An absolutely magnetic centre to it all, up-and-coming Kircher makes for a protagonist who mixes knowing sexual playfulness with a seraphic vulnerability and candour, both in moments of emotional intensity and in some remarkably candid sexual episodes (and in his looks, Kircher, the son of art-cinema icon Irène Jacob, would be a dead cert to play the late folk singing legend Nick Drake).',\n"," 'The ever-watchable Vincent Lacoste contributes his characteristic spiky humour, while older newcomer Erwan Kepoa Falé impresses as the initially distant love object who increasingly becomes an attentive surrogate sibling.',\n"," 'And Binoche is superb, her strong but generously downplayed performance fitting a film whose emotions are carried off with a lightness that seems almost casual, until the register is turned up drastically.',\n"," 'Rémy Chevrin’s fluid, highly mobile widescreen photography, with images sometimes tinged in rosy pink, suggests the ambivalent surges of feeling, memory and immediate experience.',\n"," 'Yoshihiro Hanno’s gorgeous but sober score emphasises spare strings and lyrical piano, with interpolated songs including Kepoa Falé singing Italian ballad ‘Conchiglie’ and Orchestral Manoeuevres’ ‘Electricity’ providing an incongruously upbeat dance interlude.',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," 'nan',\n"," '\\n\\nSource: Venice Film Festival\\n\\n‘The Matchmaker’\\n\\nDir: Benedetta Argentieri.',\n"," 'Italy.',\n"," '2022.',\n"," '90 mins\\n\\nThe eponymous subject of Benedetta Argentieri’s documentary The Matchmaker is notorious jihadist Tooba Gondal, who abandoned undergraduate studies in London to join the Islamic State.',\n"," 'Under the nom de guerre of Umm Muthanna al-Britannia, Gondal declared her conversion in March 2015 by posting a photograph on Twitter showing her wearing a burqa while brandishing an AK47.',\n"," 'It was captioned: “Living the life of real freedom.” Largely comprised of interviews conducted with Gondal in 2019, the documentary is a scrupulous attempt to understand how a university student became a prolific ISIS propagandist and alleged recruiter within a wider investigation of the roles of women in the Islamic State.',\n"," 'Argentieri stops short of overtly challenging Gondal’s sheer lack of accountability, but does capture many contradictions\\n\\nShowing out of competition at the Venice Film Festival, The Matchmaker will prompt discussion pertaining to whether Gondal’s claim of self-deradicalization can be taken at face value based on testimony that is extensive yet also vague and even evasive.',\n"," 'If COVID-related delays mean that her story has taken further turns since most of the footage was recorded (the French-born Gondal has been deported from Turkey to France as part of repatriation attempt), the documentary’s wider inquiry has a continued relevance which will generate interest from specialist distributors.',\n"," 'The photograph of Gondak with the Ak47 is seen early in\\xa0The Matchmaker, but does not become the focus of conversation with the subject until one hour later in order to provide her with some room for reflection.',\n"," 'The film instead\\xa0starts with the 2019 Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, which saw a coalition led by the Syrian Kurds defeat the last stronghold of the Islamic State in Syria.',\n"," 'They also captured around 12,000 women and children from 48 countries who were denied repatriation.',\n"," 'Many were detained at the Ain Issa refugee camp, which is where Argentieri encounters Gondal and her two offspring.',\n"," 'By this point absent from the Internet for several years, Gondal projects a friendly demeanour that is the polar opposite of her fiercely combative online identity.',\n"," 'She recalls her disillusionment with upper-middle-class UK life, becoming radicalised through Twitter, and her years in the Islamic State during which she was married three times to husbands who were all killed while fighting for the terror group.',\n"," 'In addition, Argentieri talks to Syrian Democratic Forces operation commander Aryian Qamishlo and several Yazidi women who were abducted by ISIS.',\n"," 'All vigorously contest the view that women in the jihad are not active participants by explaining that they are actually involved in military activities and run the slave trade.',\n"," 'The only male interviewee here is the academic Simon Cottee, who specialises in terrorism studies and has been keeping track of Gondal since 2015.',\n"," 'Nonetheless, it’s Gondal who receives most of the screen time.',\n"," 'In this respect, the initial hour may not be particularly revealing for anyone who has read Cottee’s 2016 Vice article “How a British College Student Became an ISIS Matchmaker” which drew heavily on Gondal’s blogs and Twitter feed.',\n"," 'It is, however, a strong example of the process that a filmmaker goes through to build a rapport with their subject, especially one with whom they have considerable differences to say the least.',\n"," 'Argentieri does not only see women as victims in war, while Gondal is keen to perpetuate – and arguably inhabit – the submissive stereotype.',\n"," 'This means that Gondal’s recollections become hazy when asked about her digital extremism and whether she had lured women from the West to marry jihadist fighters.',\n"," 'Argentieri stops short of overtly challenging Gondal’s sheer lack of accountability, but does capture many contradictions and indirectly counters her claims of female passivity within the Islamic State via the harrowing accounts of former slaves.',\n"," 'One of these survivors also mentions what may be Godal’s strategy: “The ISIS women will play all innocent, so that they can walk away freely.”\\n\\nAlthough it primarily examines probably the most infamous detainee at Ain Issa, the documentary also provides a nightmarish glimpse of diplomatic limbo by surveying the shantytown environment of the camp.',\n"," 'This also indicates the deeply troubling extent of Western female participation in Jihadism.',\n"," 'Upon arrival, Argentieri interacts with a Russian captive who desperately calls on Vladimir Putin to come to her aid, and a mosaic approach may have yielded more insight with regards to the involvement of Western women in this militant movement.',\n"," 'Yet the documentarian’s background in independent journalism ensures that The Matchmaker raises pertinent questions and maintains an unwavering focus, even if painstaking efforts to extract detail bump up against broad claims of “brainwashing”.',\n"," 'Aside from graphics that illustrate Twitter feeds or concisely explain relevant Islamic practices, The Matchmaker is assembled in an unvarnished manner.',\n"," 'Use of propaganda videos and extremist posts provides a disturbing sense of how such movements insidiously thrive online, but editors Matteo Mossi and Serena Pichi avoid bombarding the viewer to ensure that the interview content receives undivided attention.',\n"," 'nan',\n"," '\\n\\nSource: Groenlandia/Cattleya/Sky\\n\\n‘The Hanging Sun’\\n\\nDir: Francesco Carrozzini.',\n"," 'Italy/UK.',\n"," '2022.',\n"," '93 mins.',\n"," 'Hardened audiences have learned not to expect glittering brilliance from festival closing night films, angled as they often are for undemanding distraction.',\n"," 'But it’s a shame that the high-quality Venice 2022 selection should end on such a bathetically glum a note as The Hanging Sun, an Italo-British dollop of Nordic noir that’s not terribly Nordic, despite its origins in a story by Jo Nesbø (on board as an executive producer), and less noir than plain murky.',\n"," 'This Sky title will no doubt find an audience as casual platform fodder; more discerning viewers may feel that hanging’s too good for it.',\n"," 'More discerning viewers may feel that hanging’s too good for it\\n\\nThis is the first fiction film by Francesco Carrozzini, known for his 2016 documentary Franca: Chaos And Creation - about his mother, Vogue Italia mainstay Franca Sozzani – and famous also as a music video director for the stellar likes of Beyonce, Jay-Z and Lana del Rey.',\n"," 'Given his background, it’s surprising that there’s so little style in this stolid meat-and-potatoes thriller.',\n"," 'The setting is a supposedly remote community, apparently on an island far in the North somewhere.',\n"," 'One day a mysterious bearded stranger arrives, played by Alessandro Borghi, from this year’s Cannes competitor The Eight Mountains and TV’s Suburra: Blood On Rome.',\n"," 'He claims he’s called Ray, but we know he’s really John, and that he’s on the run from his crazed brother Michael (Frederick Schmidt) and their criminal father, known only as Dad (Peter Mullan), who has raised them both as ruthless killers.',\n"," 'Fleeing what he hopes will be his last killing, John arrives at the distant outpost, where a young woman, Lea (Jessica Brown Findlay) is tending to her young son Caleb (Raphael Vicas) and enduring the attentions of her brutish fisherman husband Aaron (Sam Spruell).',\n"," 'When Aaron is suddenly declared dead, we discover just as suddenly that he has an identical twin brother, Nicholas (also Spruell), supposedly a kinder, gentler version of Aaron, but in reality just as much of a jerk.',\n"," 'Nicholas sets his sights on Lea, which seems altogether fine by her dad Jacob (Charles Dance), the minister who reigns over this fiercely conservative, God-respecting but of course, utterly hypocritical community, dispensing sermons on fear, the Devil and the dreadful outside world.',\n"," 'Meanwhile, John mooches around the place, his heavy beard and omnipresent cap obscuring his face enough to make his emotions utterly imponderable – although when he walks fully clothed into presumably icy water, then lies face down in it, we can assume that he’s not a happy runaway.',\n"," 'Still, a cautious Lea and an altogether more enthusiastic Caleb take this gun-packing doomster to their hearts.',\n"," 'The soundtrack use of Lee Hazelwood and Nancy Sinatra’s ‘Summer Wine’ makes it clear that John is just the silver-spurred stranger that Lea has been dreaming of, and that this is one of those schematic thrillers that can lazily be categorised as ‘really’ a Western.',\n"," 'The Hanging Sun is a bizarre mess from start to finish, one of those films that seems to come from nowhere, and to be set nowhere in particular.',\n"," 'Given the supposed location – Jacob refers to it as “the edge of the world” – it’s bizarre that the locals speak with English accents, some of them downright cut-glass, as in the case of Caleb, whose eccentrically posh style of speech (“How do you intend to nourish and hydrate yourself?”) is the boy’s way of dealing with a speech impediment.',\n"," 'In reality, it makes him sound like a junior Jacob Rees-Mogg, and while young Raphael Vicas is plucky enough in the role, he’s simply the wrong choice to be believable in this part and environment; alas, Carrozzini has as bad an ear for English accents as he does for dialogue.',\n"," 'A sound supporting cast heave their characters on their backs like cardboard crucifixes.',\n"," 'Dance is acceptably silky-nasty in a lugubrious Max von Sydow sort of role, and Mullan must surely – after excelling in Ozark and The Top Of The Lake – be hankering to give his feral patriarch routine an extended holiday.',\n"," 'In a story that’s quite explicitly about resisting oppressive father figures, it’s a shame that Jessica Brown Findlay is palmed off with a role that’s largely restricted to being dourly long-suffering.',\n"," 'As for Borghi, he has some presence as a steely-eyed sulkpot, but there’s no getting past the oddness of his accent, explained by the fact that Mullan adopted John as the orphaned child of ‘immigrants’ (and where the hell were social services when that happened?).',\n"," 'DoP Nicolaj Bruel has previously distinguished himself in collaborations with Matteo Garrone (the aquarium-toned Dogman and the wildly extravagant Pinocchio), but he doesn’t bring much colour to this drab affair, which – in interiors and Norwegian-shot exteriors alike – isn’t so much atmospheric as just plain overcast.',\n"," '\\n\\nSource: Venice Film Festival\\n\\n‘Dry’\\n\\nDir: Paolo Virzi.',\n"," 'Italy.',\n"," '2022.',\n"," '124 mins.',\n"," 'After a summer when the world has sizzled, Paolo Virzi’s apocalyptic eco-drama-cum-social-satire Dry\\xa0(Siccita) could hardly be more timely, or sound a more urgent warning note.',\n"," 'It’s an honourable, clever, inventive and handsomely staged film, with a sprawling high-calibre cast.',\n"," 'The only problem is that Virzi and his co-writers, including eminent writer-director Francesca Archibugi, attempt to cover so many bases that the viewer’s mouth is soon as parched as the situation the film depicts, simply from gasping at all the narrative plate-spinning.',\n"," 'The accumulation of interlinked stories will probably be more dechipherable to Italian audiences, given the plethora of well-known domestic faces and, together with the profile of Virzi (Human Capital, The Leisure Seeker), the film promises to flourish when released in Italy in late September, even if prospects are arid elsewhere.',\n"," 'An intelligent, ambitious modern melodrama with a bracingly cynical streak\\n\\nThe premise – anything but far-fetched, alas – is a three-year drought that affects Rome, leaving the Tiber completely dried up (cue imposing CGI aerial views), with public water supplies due to be cut off any day.',\n"," 'As the city simmers, along with its inhabitants’ tempers, water becomes the precious commodity that it has always been in less privileged parts of the world – as explained by young African asylum seeker Sembene (Malich Cissé), who embodies one of the drama’s rare sites of sanity.',\n"," 'While cockroaches run riot, various Romans are afflicted by an unfamiliar form of sleeping sickness – among them,

course of a day.',\n"," 'And a seemingly unconnected thread involves a gauche long-term prisoner (much-loved Italian veteran Silvio Orlando, very affecting) who accidentally finds himself on the loose and in search of his past.',\n"," 'There’s a very strong we-are-all-one theme to Dry, of the sort familiar from films like 21 Grams and Paul Haggis’s Crash, although Virzi generally plays his coincidences with a lighter touch - only really hammering the message home when reminding us overtly that climate disaster is a human creation, or when depicting an omnipresent, infinitely hysterical media.',\n"," 'The ruinous obsession with glittering appearances, even in the face of catastrophe, is embodied by Monica Bellucci, apparently playing a version of her own persona – although the character is credited as Valentina – as a glamorous actress who quickly makes the professor forget his noble values.',\n"," 'For cinephiles, there’s also a brief and eccentric homage to director Bong Joon-ho.',\n"," 'Dry is the kind of film that could easily have been sentimental, and the Silvio Orlando thread makes it seem as if it’s going that way.',\n"," 'But, as the various stories connect – intelligently, albeit with some forced contrivance – the film falls into clear alignment, though in a way that’s not as obviously cathartic as we might expect.',\n"," 'One story’s ending in particular, involving a grotesque and absurd act of violence, doesn’t seem remotely earned or logical.',\n"," 'Overall, though, this is an intelligent, ambitious modern melodrama with a bracingly cynical streak, its narrative tangles recalling Virzi’s 2013 Human Capital.',\n"," 'Among the cast, Orlando, Mastrandrea and Lietti stand out, but partly because of their characters’ prominence, as the ensemble is so strong across the board.',\n"," 'Photography by the great Luca Bigazzi – best known for his work with Paolo Sorrentino – gives the action a sweep that’s variously epic and frenzied,

barriers.',\n"," 'Part documentary, part celebration of outsider lives, and part remembrance, it’s a defiantly hybrid piece that’s cunning, challenging and sometimes confusing, seemingly conceived to play out on the border between life and death itself.',\n"," 'Both in its editing and visually, Anhell69 is often striking\\n\\nThis all sounds depressingly artsy and overblown.',\n"," 'But two

future lies in store?',\n"," 'Following his excommunication at the age of fourteen, for masturbating whilst thinking of Jesus Christ, the dead narrator recalls that he took to smoking marijuana and watching films all day.',\n"," 'He decides to make a film himself and invites his friends to an audition, questioning these engaging but strangely non-verbal people as they recount their lives — which, as a portrait of a generation, comes over as pretty depressing.',\n"," 'In answer to the simple query “What do you do?” one interviewee replies that he “scrounges around for money”.',\n"," 'But

that\\xa0Anhell69 renders so well.',\n"," '‘Spectrophiles’ is the name given to those who are in love with the ghosts, and it’s pretty clear that Montoya himself would qualify as one:\\xa0Anhell69 is

agree on is that Medellin offers them no future: it’s best to live in the present.',\n"," 'Montoya and his friends have indeed been abandoned by the state, but the film doesn’t explore why that might be.',\n"," 'This is impressionistic fare, suggesting that the state’s legacy amongst its young is an obsession with death itself.',\n"," 'Anhell69 makes its points through an otherworldly, pulsating electronic score and potent, spectral imagery rather than through exposition.',\n"," 'Both in its editing and visually, Anhell69 is often striking — in its fragmented, strobed renditions of drag nightclubs, in the ghostly sequences from the film Montoya is going to make, in its magnificent high-altitude drone shots of Medellin at night.',\n"," 'But its best shot is left till last, as the

Loznitsa’s latest work gives the audience a front-row seat in what has become known as the ‘Ukrainian Nuremberg’ – a trial of 15 Nazis and their collaborators that took place in Kiev in January 1946.',\n"," 'One of the fascinating aspects of Loznitsa’s film is that it’s a ‘remix’ of material that was shot during the trial by a professional troupe from the Moscow Central Documentary Studio, which then languished in archives in Moscow and Kiev.',\n"," 'Despite the formality of the Soviet documentary style of the time, those 1940s camera operators clearly had an interest in the human drama that was unfolding here.',\n"," 'They used a resourceful range of fixed angles to frame the court officials, the defendants, those who were called to bear witness, and the members of the audience in the packed courtroom – some straining to catch a glimpse, some watching through opera glasses, all seemingly touched by a sense of occasion.',\n"," 'The film reminds us how important such trials can be for the affirmation of a collective identity.',\n"," 'The director and his team restored the original footage and the sound, and Loznitsa – who also gets a ‘writer’ credit – edited it and added title cards.',\n"," 'He’s not new to this game, having used a very similar method in The Trial (2018) and State Funeral (2019), but with The Kiev Trial in particular there’s a feeling that the three hours of footage uncovered here has been waiting for three-quarters of a century for someone like Loznitsa to come along and draw out both its historical significance and its contemporary resonance.',\n"," 'Pared-back intertitles inform without comment, telling us simply the names of the court officials, witnesses and defendants, and the atrocities the latter are accused of.',\n"," 'Filmed from the side as they take the witness stand, the German officers mostly respond to the questioning of the military tribunal in a matter-of-fact way – an impression that will be reinforced for non-German speakers by the gap between their un-subtitled testimony (when we have time to observe their manner, unencumbered by the knowledge of what the are saying) and the subtitled court interpreter’s translation.',\n"," 'The delay somehow makes these deadpan descriptions of operations where whole villages were wiped out all the more devastating.',\n"," 'Twice, separate defendants are asked why they shot children, too.',\n"," 'One – and the contemporary echoes are not lost on us – talks about the need to get rid of the local population in order to create ‘lebensraum’ or ‘living

factory workers were pushing back against the system, and new currents of cultural and sexual freedom were being showcased in films like Blow-Up, Aldo Braibanti, a gay Marxist writer and artist, was tried and sent to prison for a crime which had been put on the statute books in the Fascist era: imposing his personality and ideas on an impressionable subject, in this case a young male friend.',\n"," 'Strong performances may not be enough to overcome audiences’ lack of familiarity with the Braibanti case\\n\\nThe ‘Caso Braibanti’, as it was known, created a scandal at the time and made headlines around the world, but has become something of a footnote in Italian post-war history.',\n"," 'Veteran director Gianni Amelio, however, proves that it’s worth resurrecting in this baggy but earnest issue film.',\n"," 'If Amelio’s drama – which is also in a way a love story – rises above the air of conventionality that adheres to its every over-stylised tracking shot, it’s not just because of its passionate exposure of a historical injustice.',\n"," 'It’s because of the warning it contains for a contemporary Italy in which the forces of reaction are on the move once more.',\n"," 'That resonance, and the media coverage it will generate, should provide something of a return to Italian box-office form for Amelio when the film is released on September 8, soon after its Venice Competition premiere.',\n"," 'Elsewhere, however, strong performances by two of Italy’s most bankable male actors, Luigi Lo Cascio and Elio Germano, may not be enough to overcome audiences’ lack of familiarity with the Braibanti case.',\n"," 'One of the problems is the fact that the crime of ‘plagio’ itself, which existed nowhere else in the world (and was declared unconstitutional in 1981) gets lost in translation.',\n"," 'In today’s Italy, as elsewhere, it is usually applied to literary or artistic plagiarism.',\n"," 'But it also has an archaic sense derived from its Latin meaning – ‘kidnapping’.',\n"," 'This is what Braibanti was accused of by the father of a student who became his lover; kidnapping his son’s mind and soul, and by extension his body.',\n"," 'As played by Lo Cascio, Braibanti is a difficult, reserved left-wing poet, artist and avant-garde theatre director, who we see, in the flashback scenes that take up most of the film’s first half, presiding over an artistic collective in the flat agricultural landscape of his native Po Valley.',\n"," 'He seems at his ease only when studying the ant colonies he keeps in glass formicariums – or when encouraging the artistic ambitions of sensitive teenager Ettore, played convincingly by newcomer Leonardo Maltese, soon also to be seen in Marco Bellocchio’s upcoming feature The Conversion.',\n"," 'Ettore comes from a deeply Catholic and conservative family which considers both Communism and homosexuality to be curable diseases.',\n"," 'What is shocking, once we fast forward several years to a classic courtroom scene, is that many in the Italian establishment, on both sides of the political fence, seemed to agree – at least about the homosexuality.',\n"," 'Amelio and his co-writers use the invented figure played by Germano – a lowly reporter on Italian Communist Party daily ’L’Unità’ who is assigned a story his editor is clearly uncomfortable with – to convey the hypocrisy even of much of Italy’s liberal establishment.',\n"," 'Not much is made here of those mavericks who did leap to Braibanti’s defence at the time, including Pasolini, Umberto Eco and Bellocchio, who gets an executive producer credit on the film.',\n"," 'With its sombre orchestral music by go-to Italian film score composer Nicola Piovani and its old school Cinecittà craft values, Lord Of The Ants is at its best when it sticks most closely to the facts.',\n"," 'Ettore – whose real name was Giovanni – really was confined to an asylum and given corrective electro-shock therapy after his family had him bundled into a car in Rome, where he was living with Braibanti.',\n"," 'On release, he really was forbidden to read books that were “less than a hundred years old”.',\n"," 'And despite all this, he really did
